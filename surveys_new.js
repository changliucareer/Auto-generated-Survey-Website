var surveys = [{"wordSetString": "ingest,assimilate,digest,imbibe,absorb,incorporate", "original_discussion": "These verbs , all relatively formal , indicate the taking in of one thing by another . < Absorb >  is slightly more informal than the others and has , perhaps , the widest range of uses . In its most restricted sense it suggests the taking in or soaking up specifically of liquids . In more general uses absorb may imply the thoroughness of the action . Or it may stress the complete disappearance of the thing taken in within the encompassing medium . < Ingest >  refers literally to the action of taking into the mouth , as food or drugs , for later absorption by the body . Figuratively , it designates any taking in and suggests the receptivity necessary for such a process . To < digest >  is to alter food chemically in the digestive tract so that it can be absorbed into the bloodstream . In other uses , digest is like absorb in stressing thoroughness , but is even more emphatic . < Assimilate >  is even more emphatic about the thoroughness of the taking in than either absorb or digest -- in both its specific physiological and general uses . Physiologically , food is first digested , then absorbed by the bloodstream , and then assimilated bit by bit in each cell the blood passes . In more general uses , assimilate , unlike the previous verbs , often implies a third agent beside the absorber and the absorbed -- an agent that directs this process . The process , furthermore , often implies the complete transformation of the absorbed into the absorbing medium . Assimilate also suggests a much slower process than digest and certainly than absorb , which can be nearly instantaneous . < Incorporate >  is the only verb here that does not have a specific use pertaining to the taking in of liquids or of food , meaning literally embody . It resembles the aspect of assimilate that stresses the loss of separate identity for the absorbed quantity . It is unlike assimilate in lacking that verb's suggestion of necessarily careful , time-consuming thoroughness . < Imbibe >,  while capable of uses comparable to those for assimilate , is mainly rooted still to its specific use for the taking in of liquids . Even this use , and certainly any others , now sound slightly archaic and excessively formal .", "questionList": [{"question": "the liquid {_?_} by the sponge .", "options": ["ingested", "assimilated", "digested", "imbibed", "absorbed", "incorporated"], "answer": "absorbed"}, {"question": "not merely to read the chapter , but to {_?_} its meaning .", "options": ["ingest", "assimilate", "digest", "imbibe", "absorb", "incorporate"], "answer": "absorb"}, {"question": "once-lovely countryside soon {_?_} by urban sprawl .", "options": ["ingested", "assimilated", "digested", "imbibed", "absorbed", "incorporated"], "answer": "absorbed"}, {"question": "too tired to {_?_} even one more idea from the complicated philosophical essay she was reading .", "options": ["ingest", "assimilate", "digest", "imbibe", "absorb", "incorporate"], "answer": "ingest"}, {"question": "You may completely {_?_} a stirring play in one evening , but you will be months ____ it .", "options": ["ingest", "assimilate", "digest", "imbibe", "absorb", "incorporate"], "answer": "absorb"}, {"question": "You may completely ____ a stirring play in one evening , but you will be months {_?_} it .", "options": ["ingesting", "assimilating", "digesting", "imbibing", "absorbing", "incorporating"], "answer": "digesting"}, {"question": "architects who {_?_} their buildings to the environment .", "options": ["ingest", "assimilate", "digest", "imbibe", "absorb", "incorporate"], "answer": "assimilate"}, {"question": "It would take the city generations to {_?_} the newcomers into the patterns of a strange life .", "options": ["ingest", "assimilate", "digest", "imbibe", "absorb", "incorporate"], "answer": "assimilate"}, {"question": "{_?_} your proposals into a new system that will satisfy everyone .", "options": ["ingesting", "assimilating", "digesting", "imbibing", "absorbing", "incorporating"], "answer": "incorporating"}, {"question": "Do you {_?_} alcoholic beverages ?", "options": ["ingest", "assimilate", "digest", "imbibe", "absorb", "incorporate"], "answer": "imbibe"}]}, {"wordSetString": "refrain,forbear,abstain", "original_discussion": "The verb < abstain >  means withhold oneself from an action or self-indulgence . < Refrain >  has to do with withholding an action temporarily , or checking a momentary desire .

Both nouns have uses , on the other hand , in which the part remains distinguishable from and subordinate to the whole . A supplement can also be a standard or special section of a newspaper . < Appendix >,  Eke supplement , can refer to a part of a book , but is more often bound with the book itself . Neither of these is essential to the book's completeness , although both would offer additional details on given material . < Appendage >  refers to a more integral part of a whole than do any of the other terms . It is especially used in the life sciences to indicate the limbs or extremities of a plant or animal . No one except such a scientist , however , is likely -- even in the most formal of contexts -- to use appendage in preference to em , branch , arm , leg , tail , or whatever . Biologists themselves , in fact , can be every bit as precise and certainly more succinct in speaking of a monkey's tail rather than its caudal appendage . In other uses of this noun , the subordination of the part to the whole is emphasized . Such uses may be rather stiff except when a note of mockery is conveyed . < Appurtenance >  and < adjunct >  both refer to a part that becomes a valuable addition to a whole , though not essential to it . Appurtenance has a specific legal sense of an incidental property right that goes along with a major right , such as the right of way to a building . The sense of a gratuitous advantage pervades its other meanings as well . In adjunct , the separateness of the added part is stressed . < Attachment >  and < accessory >  refer to parts that are neither essential to nor fused with the whole they complement .

When used by itself , no particular degree of fear is indicated . In most uses , being afraid is personal , and the fear has to do with bodily harm . Afraid is also used in polite discourse to indicate nothing more than mild concern . Sometimes this use conceals great fear . < Frightened >  and < scared >  often suggest fear of bodily harm , but both may be used to describe vague fears of unknown source . Frightened has a more genteel sound than scared , but both apply strictly to physically felt fear , even if the causes are emotional or imaginary . < Anxious >  means tense and worried . < Fearful >  may mean full of terror or dread , but more often means merely < apprehensive >, --  that is , anticipating danger , failure , or trouble . In the latter sense , fearful shares with anxious the suggestion that the worry stems from inner concern without much relevance to external conditions , and is in this sense perhaps unreasonable . Apprehensive suggests awareness of impending danger caused by circumstances , and does not depend so much on one's personal nature or habitual state of mind . < Aghast >, < alarmed >,  and < terror-stricken >  are applied to strong feelings of fear or fright . Aghast means afraid or frightened to the point of shock . A couple waking up in a burning house will be aghast at the thought that their children may be in grave danger . Alarmed means suddenly and sharply afraid or frightened . Parents will be alarmed by a sudden outbreak of tuberculosis in their community .

Unlike any of these other nouns , however , anxiety can refer to a fear of the future per se and not just of a single hazard . This meaning is particularly used by psychiatrists to refer to patients who are immobilized by such a feeling without being able to explain what it is they fear . Anxiety also relates , on the other hand , to nouns of this group that are not necessarily tied to fear of the future . Existential philosophers developed this meaning to refer to the helpless , all-encompassing frustration of the human condition when confronted with the inex-plicability of life . Today , this kind of anxiety is often referred to by the noun < angst >,  from the Danish of the philosopher soren Kierkegaard . H . Auden claims that our fear of the future is really a fear of ourselves and our own irrepressible angst . < Dread >, < apprehension >,  and < foreboding >  emphasize the fear of something that has yet to happen . Dread is the most intense of any of the nouns listed here , with overtones of helplessness in the face of something as inevitable as it is terrible . The thing dreaded may be a specific occurrence or a somewhat undefined evil that is nonetheless terrifying to consider . Dread can , of course , be used hyper-bolically for more trivial occasions . Apprehension is more formal than either dread or anxiety , less intense in feeling , and applying to vaguer fears of a future happening . It is not so much a harmful inevitability that is foreseen as an uncertain outcome that keeps one in suspense . Like anxiety , foreboding is midway between dread and apprehension in its formality , its intensity , and its conviction of certain or possible harm . What sets foreboding aside is its aura of superstitiousness . Foreboding can be used without this overtone , however , in which case it points to a more general nagging doubt about the future . < Worry >  is far less formal than the previous nouns and implies an obsessive concern for far more mundane matters . It frequently appears in the plural .

In another sense , however , the aesthetic attitude might be taken as generic , the artistic attitude as a specific but by no means exhaustive example of the more general term . In this distinction , the aesthetic instinct expresses itself in all areas of fife where taste , discrimination , style , and balance are desirable . In yet another sense , aesthetic describes specifically those discriminations sorted out by aestheticians ; one connotation here may be unnecessary refinement or passivity as opposed to the boldness and activity of the artistic attitude . In describing a work of art rather than an attitude , aesthetic would be largely irrelevant , artistic inane or tautological . Both may be used to praise creations not commonly thought of as works of art . < Arty >  and < mannered >  both refer to attitudes that tend toward parody of the artistic sensibility . Arty , the more strongly negative of the two , is also the most informal of any of these adjectives . It suggests the phoniness of the poseur or artist manque , stressing particularly exaggerated and affected behavior that may be totally unrelated to the creation of works of art . Mannered is more formal and more restrained in its disapproval . It suggests behavior that is contrived and unnatural . Mannered can also refer to the work of art itself , suggesting the same qualities of contrived artificiality . < Artificial >  most often refers only to the work , suggesting a lack of spontaneity and of naturalness . It is more negative in tone than mannered . The latter may suggest worthwhile content that has been harmed by unnecessary stylistic manipulation . Artificial , on the other hand , suggests a lack of content that a pretentious style is struggling to conceal . < Stylized >  is like mannered and artificial in suggesting an emphasis on mode as opposed to content , but it contrasts with them in ranging from a neutral to an approving tone . It emphasizes the ordering of the artist's raw materials into significant , if unrealistic , designs . < Precious >  is the most negative in tone of any adjective here and is the most freewheeling in range , applying to the work , the artist , or to someone who is not artistic in any way . It points to a taste for the genteel and overelegant , especially when these qualities are as far removed as possible from reality or normality . It suggests a complaisant attempt to be different and striking , and typically results in overstylized affectation -- cute , in the worst sense of the word . < Tasteful >  and < harmonious >  refer to aesthetic qualities that may be found in artistic works . Tasteful is extremely subjective in referring to what is in accordance with the canons of taste ; what is tasteful to one person , such as a pink and purple Christmas tree , might be thought vulgar by another . Harmonious is more objective in pointing to a smooth , well-balanced relation of parts .

On the other hand , helper is frequently used in the area of manual labor , while assistant implies a position within a profession and is sometimes part of an official title . < Subordinate >  emphasizes the inferiority of a helper or assistant , and its greater formality does not always mitigate an overtone of condescension , sometimes extending even to contempt . Subordinate can , however , be neutral in tone , merely describing an unequal relationship . < Adjutant >  and < aide >  are drawn from military life to describe the administrative assistant or subordinate of a superior officer .

While it implies close connection , the relationship might be the result of choice , chance , or necessity . In a more specific use , associate , used attribu-tively to modify a noun , is a component of some professional titles , denoting the second of three ranks . It is also used specifically to indicate less than full membership in a group . In this sense , the noun associate may refer either to a person or to a group within a larger group . < Affiliate >  compares with this use of associate in being now mostly used of a group related to another group . It is frequently used to relate a small group to a national or international parent group . Affiliate suggests that two affiliates are coequal in a loose relationship of autonomous groups , even when a smaller-to-larger hierarchy is involved . This contrasts with associate in its suggestion of subordinate membership in a group . < Ally >  and < partner >  may apply either to individuals or to groups . Ally always suggests a relationship of choice . One's allies unite with one in a common cause and most often against a common enemy . Allies are not necessarily friends outside the cause that jointly concerns them . Ally is chiefly used in reference to nations that are on the same side in an international war . Partner , like ally , may apply to one nation joined with another in a common cause . But partner often indicates a closer or a contractual relationship . It is the legal term for one of the co-owners of a business . She was made a partner in the law firm . And it may also refer to a much more personal association . Unlike the other nouns in this group , partner sometimes points to a one-to-one relationship involving a couple or a pair . The remaining nouns refer exclusively to person-to-person relationships , as does associate in its more general sense . < Coworker >  is the least formal of these and applies as readily to manual labor as to more highly skilled occupations . Coworker is distinctly neutral in tone , implying neither animosity nor the cordiality that may be suggested by associate . < Colleague >  is restricted almost solely in use to professional association . It is formal in tone , but may range in feeling from neutrality to an expression of respect or approbation . < Fellow >,  as here considered , is now seldom used except as a title or component .

Assail means attack violently and repeatedly , implying that victory depends not so much on the force or effectiveness of one's attack but on one's persistence and pertinacity .

Where fundamental indicates an initial necessity , absolute suggests final and conclusive authority . Ultimate also suggests the highest or final authority . Unlike absolute , it carries an implication of something worked through in time . < Unlimited >,  while suggesting totality , contrasts with ultimate in relating more often to quantity than to time . It compares with absolute in suggesting less a highest authority than one to which no opposition exists . Categorical in its philosophical sense refers to something , usually a principle , that is inescapable , undeniable , and universal .

In this sense basis and base are practically synonymous ; base , however , more often suggests the idea of an underlying < foundation >,  whereas basis is broader in application and may suggest the idea of a central or fundamental part as well as that of an underlying principle . Foundation can mean the base on which something rests . Foundation suggests a more imposing , solid structure than base , which can apply to the bottom part of anything . Foundation also means that on which anything is founded , and in this sense is close to basis . It should perhaps be noted that foundation is now used commercially to refer to a variety of feminine accouterments that supply an underlying basis or that give support , such as facial makeup applied beneath other makeup and certain undergarments that restrain vital parts of the body so that out-ergarments do not reveal their actual shape . < Ground >,  as here considered , means a foundation or basis for a decision , argument , or relationship .

It perhaps most strongly suggests a pummeling with the fists ; this may be the result of spur-of-the-moment anger between opponents . But beat can also suggest a more deliberate inflicting of punishment on an inferior by a superior . In these latter cases , some sort of instrument may well be used . < Thrash >  is more likely to be restricted to the first situation , expressing spontaneous anger between opponents . Although fisticuffs might be the main element of the attack , thrash suggests a general sort of knocking about by any means whatsoever . Thrash may have a euphemistic flavor in that it seems to imply a less serious or cruel infliction of injury than beat , and may be an attempt to make light of the intent behind the act ; but it can , despite this , indicate a more thorough or methodical act than beat and often suggests an act motivated by the wish to reprove some-one for insolence or misbehavior . < Spank >  is more specific than either beat or thrash in its application . It refers unambiguously to the corrective or salutary punishment meted out by a parent on a child , with no intent to inflict actual harm . The action specifically involves hitting the child's buttocks with the open hand , often with the child laid face-down across the parent's knees . [ G . B . Shaw wondered how parents could wait until their anger had cooled in order to spank their children in cold blood . ] The remaining verbs all relate to punishment meted out by means of some instrument , usually one held in the hand . The following verbs specifically stress the inflicting of physical injury to a degree that is not a necessary implication of the verbs discussed so far . < Whip >  suggests the beating of someone usually by means of a flexible cord or series of cords expressly designed for this use , made of leather , metal , or rope and attached to a handle . Whip , less specifically , can refer to any act of beating done by means of any sort of instrument , whether flexible or rigid , whether improvised or designed for the occasion . < Scourge >  is often used metaphorically for any calamity or harsh attack , but it refers most concretely to beating with a many-tongued or many-thonged whip . In this sense , however , it is less often used except in reference to the Biblical account of Christ's being scourged . < Flog >  may specifically suggest whipping , especially with a many-tongued lash , but it can also indicate beating with any sort of instrument , flexible or rigid . A historical context unique to flog is the nautical one in which this sort of punishment was inflicted upon sailors for certain infractions of orders . Flog might also apply in this way to military or penal situations . < Flagellate >,  most strictly , has a religious or psychosexual context . In either case the infliction of pain is emphasized and is carried out by means of whip , lash , or other cord-like instrument , often many-tongued , knotted , barbed , or nettled , although this may be applied by oneself or by others , especially ( as with flog ) across the back . Religious zealots may engage in this activity to punish the flesh for its inherent sinfulness , and sado-masochistic neurotics may engage in flagellation for the sexual stimulation it affords them .", "questionList": [{"question": "ruffians who {_?_} the child up after school .", "options": ["whip", "flog", "thrash", "spank", "scourge", "flagellate", "beat"], "answer": "beat"}, {"question": "a psychotic mother who {_?_} her children unmercifully .", "options": ["whipped", "flogged", "thrashed", "spanked", "scourged", "flagellated", "beat"], "answer": "beat"}, {"question": "{_?_} the dog with a rolled-up newspaper .", "options": ["whipping", "flogging", "thrashing", "spanking", "scourging", "flagellating", "beating"], "answer": "beating"}, {"question": "threatening to {_?_} the boy within an inch of his life unless he took back the insult .", "options": ["whip", "flog", "thrash", "spank", "scourge", "flagellate", "beat"], "answer": "thrash"}, {"question": "{_?_} the horse into a quicker pace ; ordering that the mutinous soldiers be put in irons and ____ .", "options": ["whipping", "flogging", "thrashing", "spanking", "scourging", "flagellating", "beating"], "answer": "whipping"}, {"question": "____ the horse into a quicker pace ; ordering that the mutinous soldiers be put in irons and {_?_} .", "options": ["whipped", "flogged", "thrashed", "spanked", "scourged", "flagellated", "beat"], "answer": "whipped"}, {"question": "known to {_?_} prisoners with a razor strop or a metal ruler ; claiming that his interrogators had pistol-whipped him .", "options": ["whip", "flog", "thrash", "spank", "scourge", "flagellate", "beat"], "answer": "whip"}, {"question": "suspected informers who were {_?_} with chains before being killed .", "options": ["whipped", "flogged", "thrashed", "spanked", "scourged", "flagellated", "beaten", "beat"], "answer": "flogged"}]}, {"wordSetString": "handsome,cute,pretty,good-looking,comely,gorgeous,beautiful", "original_discussion": "These adjectives refer to pleasing facial appearances . < Beautiful >  indicates a strikingly desirable or attractive face , suggesting symmetry of features or perfection of proportion , although ultimately beautiful is dependent on the subjective taste of the user . Because of this it is extremely unspecific in reference , although it would most often be used of a woman's face . < Good-looking >  is equally as weak in specificity , but it can be used appropriately of both men and women . < Handsome >  and < pretty >  are complementary terms in that handsome usually applies to men and pretty even more exclusively to women . Pretty , however , indicates a less elevated or more superficial appeal than beautiful . In this opposition , pretty might suggest vivacity and sweetness , while beautiful might suggest elegance and nobility . Handsome , used of men , is comparable to beautiful , used of women , suggesting regularity of features and a sturdy manliness . Sometimes handsome may be used of women as well , in which case it does not , strangely enough , suggest an epicene mannishness , but a radiant force of almost animal good health and vividness . Handsome in this sense would be used only of mature women , never of girls . Pretty would never be used of a man , except pejoratively to suggest effeminacy . Beautiful may rarely be used of a man without negative effect ; in this case the face is usually regarded in an artistic light or as redolent of some special attribute . Because < comely >  may now sound outdated , it is sometimes used to suggest earthy or rustic good looks in women . Once its particular emphasis , however , was on freedom from blemish , as in the Song of Solomon . < Cute >  is an informal word for good looks in women that suggest cheerfulness and wholesomeness ; cute , thus , gives less praise than pretty and far less than beautiful .

In many contexts < start >  is interchangeable with begin . But start places more emphasis on the fact of making a beginning , the mere act of setting out , whereas begin often suggests the start of a process in fulfillment of a purpose . The relationship between start and begin is not unlike that between the nouns speed and velocity ; the second verb , start , implies direction . < Commence >  is a more formal term for begin . There are practically no contexts in which begin will not serve well in place of commence , but commence , and sometimes < institute >,  is preferred in some contexts , especially legal , where begin is felt to be insufficiently formal , too much an everyday word , to dignify the proceedings . Thus , legal action is instituted , rarely begun , and judicial sessions commence , seldom begin . Commence is sometimes used vulgarly or humorously in other than solemn contexts . Institute in other senses means begin with a view toward setting up or putting into operation . Institute suggests a great deal of enterprise , and frequently foresight as well . < Initiate >  is close to institute in pointing to the motivating force or creator that starts something , but does not , like institute , convey the idea of carrying through what one has started to the point of seeing it in operation . < Inaugurate >  means begin formally or officially . Thus to inaugurate a new policy or legislation suggests some ceremony or traditional observance to commemorate it . Inaugurate is also used for begin in historical contexts implying great scope or import . < Launch >  is a related word , but means to begin not so much with ceremony as with fanfare and publicity .

Intolerance is used widely outside the context of racial , religious , or ethnic prejudice , however , when it indicates an inability to give a fair hearing to ideas at variance with one's own . < Bias >  is unique among these nouns , since it can point to a predisposition either for or against something .

In a biological sense , it can refer to any living organism in which both male and female organs are present . For many forms of life , this is normal . Thus , as a generic term , bisexual can group together all normally double-sexed plants and animals . In its reference to people , however , bisexual would never refer to those rare individuals who are abnormally bo rn with both male and female organs . On the contrary , it refers to those people who , physiologically male or female , are psychologically responsive to both sexes . This responsiveness may extend to erotic attraction or to sexual activity . Many psychologists view every individual as being normally bisexual in makeup , although only those men and women who have both homosexual and heterosexual relations can be called actively bisexual . The word is not likely to be used to describe someone whose appearance combines both male and female characteristics . < Hermaphroditic >  and < androgynous >  are more clear-cut in their reference to biological description . Hermaphroditic refers most specifically as a zoological term to animals in which the organs of both sexes appear normally in each individual , whereas androgynous applies as a botanical term to such double-sexed plants . Among such sexually polarized species as man , of course , a hermaphroditic individual may rarely occur as a biological abnormality , but the word would be reserved for those cases in which both male and female sexual organs are anatomically present . Sometimes , hermaphroditic is used less technically to refer to general appearance that partakes of both sexes . In this case , hermaphroditic carries a tone of hyperbolic disapproval or amusement . Androgynous has a more formal ring even in its strict biological use , and can sound abstruse or curious when it applies more generally ; here , it is not so likely to be confused with reference to biological structure . < Epicene >  has no relevance whatever to biological classification , referring strictly to someone who in appearance or attitudes unites qualities of both sexes . Epicene usually carries a disapproving or at least negative tone . Unlike bisexual , epicene may not refer to activity at all and may in fact suggest someone who appears sexless or is marked by no strong characteristics of either sex . In a culture that places a high value on manliness , epicene can often refer to effeminacy in men or even to neurasthenic male qualities . < Polymorphous perverse >  is a fad phrase that oddly enough can carry an approving tone . It refers to sexual behavior that not only may be bisexual but guilt-lessly pregenital in gaining satisfaction from other erogenous zones . The phrase , coined by Freud to describe the nonpolarized sexuality normal to the child , is now used loosely to describe a whole range of experimental adult sexual behavior .", "questionList": [{"question": "{_?_} flowers ; ____ angle-worms .", "options": ["hermaphroditic", "polymorphous perverse", "bisexual", "androgynous", "epicene"], "answer": "bisexual"}, {"question": "____ flowers ; {_?_} angle-worms .", "options": ["hermaphroditic", "polymorphous perverse", "bisexual", "androgynous", "epicene"], "answer": "bisexual"}, {"question": "that transitional phase when adolescents are {_?_} in their sympathies and loyalties .", "options": ["hermaphroditic", "polymorphous perverse", "bisexual", "androgynous", "epicene"], "answer": "bisexual"}, {"question": "viewing the volvox either as a colony of cells or as a {_?_} organism ; effecting the hybridizing of com by the sexual polarization of a normally ____ species .", "options": ["hermaphroditic", "polymorphous perverse", "bisexual", "androgynous", "epicene"], "answer": "hermaphroditic"}, {"question": "viewing the volvox either as a colony of cells or as a ____ organism ; effecting the hybridizing of com by the sexual polarization of a normally {_?_} species .", "options": ["hermaphroditic", "polymorphous perverse", "bisexual", "androgynous", "epicene"], "answer": "androgynous"}, {"question": "The hair styles of many young people grow more and more {_?_} .", "options": ["hermaphroditic", "polymorphous perverse", "bisexual", "androgynous", "epicene"], "answer": "hermaphroditic"}, {"question": "cultures in which sexual role-playing is relatively {_?_} outside such biological functions as childbearing .", "options": ["hermaphroditic", "polymorphous perverse", "bisexual", "androgynous", "epicene"], "answer": "androgynous"}, {"question": "a large , puffy face with soft features that were strikingly {_?_} in appearance .", "options": ["hermaphroditic", "polymorphous perverse", "bisexual", "androgynous", "epicene"], "answer": "epicene"}, {"question": "cultural stereotypes of the virile warrior and the {_?_} intellectual .", "options": ["hermaphroditic", "polymorphous perverse", "bisexual", "androgynous", "epicene"], "answer": "epicene"}, {"question": "distinguishing between foreplay that is {_?_} and a sole concentration on such acts .", "options": ["hermaphroditic", "polymorphous perverse", "bisexual", "androgynous", "epicene"], "answer": "polymorphous perverse"}]}, {"wordSetString": "sourness,acerbity,bitterness,harshness,asperity,acrimony", "original_discussion": "These nouns refer to a caustic , sharp , or rancorous temper or manner . < Bitterness >  can indicate , most generally , a gloomy , dour , or cold disposition , but its special connotations suggest a deep-seated rage directed inward more than an anger directed at others , with disillusion or a conviction of injustice as its possible source and a smoldering cynicism as its possible result . < Sourness >  is less intense than bitterness , but suggests somewhat the same dour manner with an inward-directed disillusion as its source .

A contrast with genial is apparent in that one may behave in a genial way regardless of how one feels , whereas the very essence of lighthearted is its suggestion of a spontaneous welling up of high spirits . Genial , furthermore , suggests friendly relationships with others ; light-hearted may pertain to someone completely alone . < Convivial >  serves as an intensification of genial , suggesting jolly sociability and warm fellow-feeling ; its Latin root pertains to a feast or banquet , and this is often reflected in the English use of the word . < Jovial >  may suggest sociability , but it is less specific in indicating any sort of good-natured amiability . Jovial is often used to describe a jolly but dignified fat person , so much so that it is sometimes taken to specify this situation . Similarly , blithe sometimes suggests a spry , elfin , or fey person , particularly a woman . Although neither of these associations is invariable , it would seem odd to speak of a jovial wisp of a girl or a blithe Santa Claus . < Elated >  and < ebullient >  both refer , like light-hearted , to a welling up of high spirits . Elated , however , can often refer to a response to some external occurrence or news , whereas ebullient suggests the same spontaneity as lighthearted .

Direct steaming is usually accomplished by placing a metal rack above the level of the boiling water in a pot so that the food does not touch the water . < Poach >  implies a method of cooking a few foods , such as eggs without their shells , or pieces of chicken or fish , by dropping them into hot water , milk , or stock and simmering until done . < Stew >  is a close synonym of simmer in that both mean cook slowly in liquid over low heat . However , to most people , stew strongly suggests the familiar dish that is cooked in this way -- meat or fish combined with vegetables in a gravy or sauce . Stewing always involves simmering , but one may simmer ( not stew ) soups , vegetables , sauces , etc . When cooks speak of stewing meat , they usually mean < braising >  it .

Sauteing is done very quickly with a minimum amount of fat and may or may not imply browning . Meat is usually sauteed before it is braised .

It simply indicates a prominent bone structure , whether this is deemed a sign of attractiveness , asceticism , chronic undernourishment , or near-starvation . Bony is frequently applied to a single part of the body . And it may sometimes emphasize attributes of bone that are not seen but felt , such as hardness or sharpness . < Gaunt >  implies a paucity of flesh and prominence of bone . It comes from the Old Norse word for a tall , thin person , and it indicates an angular leanness . Specifically , gaunt often calls to mind the haggard look of the hungry , anguished , ill , or old . It suggests the weariness of long suffering or constant strain , describing one who seems to have been worn down to the bone . < Wasted >  implies a loss of flesh , stressing the cause of bony thinness . A wasted body is one that has been gradually consumed -- reduced to skin and bone by the ravages of time , grief , hunger , or disease . Hence , wasted implies physical weakness and frailty . < Emaciated >  focuses on both the cause and the fact of abnormal leanness . It indicates a previous wasting away , implying the depletion of the body by grave illness , great suffering , or terrible privation . < Skeletal >  is the most extreme of all these terms , pointing to the deathlike dominance of bone . Both skeletal and emaciated may suggest the leanness of living people who look like skeletons , their ribs and sharp bones showing through the skin .

In disapproval , nerve suggests a shameless disregard for good taste or manners . < Brass >  and < cheek >  both indicate an insistent and insolent self-assurance . Brass is the more disapproving of the two , suggesting a coarse or ingrained lack of sensitivity to the feelings of others . Cheek is milder in suggesting a smug or simpering self-regard that prompts uncritical , brazen , or tasteless behavior . Like sauciness , cheek can be used humorously or affectionately for a cute forwardness in one's inferiors . < Gall >  is the most severely disapproving of all these nouns , suggesting shameless acts of unwarranted discourtesy . But gall is very general , applying to any act one dislikes .", "questionList": [{"question": "the {_?_} of such a small country in successfully defending itself against its enemies ; a foolhardy ____ that often tempted him to tackle situations he knew nothing about ; the ____ with which she pushed her way to the top of the heap , injuring the feelings of everyone else in the office .", "options": ["sauciness", "chutzpah", "cheek", "brashness", "nerve", "brass", "gall"], "answer": "brashness"}, {"question": "the ____ of such a small country in successfully defending itself against its enemies ; a foolhardy {_?_} that often tempted him to tackle situations he knew nothing about ; the ____ with which she pushed her way to the top of the heap , injuring the feelings of everyone else in the office .", "options": ["sauciness", "chutzpah", "cheek", "brashness", "nerve", "brass", "gall"], "answer": "brashness"}, {"question": "the ____ of such a small country in successfully defending itself against its enemies ; a foolhardy ____ that often tempted him to tackle situations he knew nothing about ; the {_?_} with which she pushed her way to the top of the heap , injuring the feelings of everyone else in the office .", "options": ["sauciness", "chutzpah", "cheek", "brashness", "nerve", "brass", "gall"], "answer": "brashness"}, {"question": "The {_?_} of his sports clothes almost made my eyeballs ache .", "options": ["sauciness", "chutzpah", "cheek", "brashness", "nerve", "brass", "gall"], "answer": "brashness"}, {"question": "the {_?_} of that impertinent salesgirl ; the indignant ____ with which he refused to take his nap .", "options": ["sauciness", "chutzpah", "cheek", "brashness", "nerve", "brass", "gall"], "answer": "sauciness"}, {"question": "the ____ of that impertinent salesgirl ; the indignant {_?_} with which he refused to take his nap .", "options": ["sauciness", "chutzpah", "cheek", "brashness", "nerve", "brass", "gall"], "answer": "sauciness"}, {"question": "the roguish {_?_} of a small kitten ; the boy's ____ in grandly declining to play house with his older sister .", "options": ["sauciness", "chutzpah", "cheek", "brashness", "nerve", "brass", "gall"], "answer": "sauciness"}, {"question": "the roguish ____ of a small kitten ; the boy's {_?_} in grandly declining to play house with his older sister .", "options": ["sauciness", "chutzpah", "cheek", "brashness", "nerve", "brass", "gall"], "answer": "sauciness"}, {"question": "her {_?_} in demanding the best table in the restaurant .", "options": ["sauciness", "chutzpah", "cheek", "brashness", "nerve", "brass", "gall"], "answer": "chutzpah"}, {"question": "Give me someone who knows what he wants and has the {_?_} to go after it without shilly-shallying ; a patient who had the ____ to charge into the doctor's office ahead of everyone else in the waiting room .", "options": ["sauciness", "chutzpah", "cheek", "brashness", "nerve", "brass", "gall"], "answer": "chutzpah"}, {"question": "Give me someone who knows what he wants and has the ____ to go after it without shilly-shallying ; a patient who had the {_?_} to charge into the doctor's office ahead of everyone else in the waiting room .", "options": ["sauciness", "chutzpah", "cheek", "brashness", "nerve", "brass", "gall"], "answer": "chutzpah"}, {"question": "It took {_?_} for her to stand up for her rights in an atmosphere thick with recrimination and threats of reprisal .", "options": ["sauciness", "chutzpah", "cheek", "brashness", "nerve", "brass", "gall"], "answer": "nerve"}, {"question": "Imagine the {_?_} of him inviting himself to stay the weekend !", "options": ["sauciness", "chutzpah", "cheek", "brashness", "nerve", "brass", "gall"], "answer": "nerve"}, {"question": "Not even the prosecutor had the {_?_} to ignore the tears of the child on the witness stand .", "options": ["sauciness", "chutzpah", "cheek", "brashness", "nerve", "brass", "gall"], "answer": "brass"}, {"question": "the {_?_} to ask for a raise after only a week on the job .", "options": ["sauciness", "chutzpah", "cheek", "brashness", "nerve", "brass", "gall"], "answer": "cheek"}, {"question": "the {_?_} of the boy in asking for another helping of dessert .", "options": ["sauciness", "chutzpah", "cheek", "brashness", "nerve", "brass", "gall"], "answer": "cheek"}, {"question": "the {_?_} to show up for dinner with three of his friends .", "options": ["sauciness", "chutzpah", "cheek", "brashness", "nerve", "brass", "gall"], "answer": "gall"}]}, {"wordSetString": "brave,dauntless,fearless,bold,valorous,gallant,heroic,intrepid,undaunted,courageous,plucky,valiant", "original_discussion": "These adjectives indicate a readiness to face danger , difficulty , or even death when called upon by circumstance to do so . < Brave >  is the most general term . It indicates the showing of one's mettle under stress , implying self-possession and resolution . < Courageous >,  like brave , may focus on response to a situation , but it often implies firmness arising from strong moral convictions . Both adjectives imply a willingness to proceed with what is necessary in spite of external deterrents or internal misgivings . A brave or courageous soldier carries out a dangerous mission , not without fear , but without letting fear deter him from doing his duty . < Dauntless >  and < undaunted >  indicate braver } ' under exceptionally trying circumstances . Both imply a refusal to be disheartened , intimidated , or otherwise discouraged from going on . < Fearless >  and < intrepid >  imply a resolute freedom from fear or a cool , unshakable determination . < Valiant >  and < valorous >  are applied to persons and actions that exhibit the kind of courage and fortitude associated with knighthood . Valiant may suggest bravery shown in a worthy cause , against impossible odds , or with commendable consequences . Valorous is usually applied to the spirit or deeds of the valiant . A valiant firefighter , showing valorous disregard of personal safety , may rescue persons trapped in a burning building . A dying person may put up a valiant , but hopeless , fight for fife . < Heroic >  and < gallant >  imply outstanding bravery coupled with nobility of motive or selfless dedication . Heroic stresses exceptional courage , fortitude , or enterprise , especially in time of war or danger . It implies a willingness to risk or sacrifice one's own life to save others .

It indicates a temporary time-out , as from work , for rest , refreshment , recreation , or other purpose . < Pause >  is less abrupt and drastic , indicating a brief rest or a momentary suspension of action . A scheduled interruption of a radio or TV program that is called a station break at the studio is referred to in milder terms on the air as a pause for station identification . Pause is also used to stress the temporary nature of a cease-fire . < respite >  is a much more formal synonym for break . A respite is an interval of relief , as from some source of strain . One takes a break but is granted a respite . A <recess>  is an interval between the sessions of a school , court , legislature , or the like . It implies a formal adjournment for a limited time , with a temporary suspension of business . A recess may be as brief as a break or as long as a vacation , but it presupposes some sort of official authorization . In grammar school , a recess is a free period between classroom sessions during which the children may play , relax , or get something to eat . An < interlude >  is a period or episode that occurs in the course of a longer process and breaks its continuity . By nature , an interlude contrasts with the activity it interrupts or the events it comes between -- often occurring as an interval of calm , a time of content , or a touch of comic relief . An < intermission >  is a scheduled recess between the acts of a play or the parts of a performance . Interlude , on the other hand , may apply to an entertainment of a different kind that fills a break between the acts , as a brief , farcical comedy or a short , transitional passage of music . In another sense , intermission may apply to any temporary cessation . < Letup >  is an informal word and is usually used negatively after no or without . It often indicates abatement rather than cessation , pointing to a lessening of force , a slackening of pace , or a reduction in number or intensity . < Lull >  designates an interval of stillness or calm that contrasts with prior and subsequent noise or confusion . Lull may also refer to a falling off of activity , implying a loss of momentum and suggesting the sluggishness of a slack period .", "questionList": [{"question": "a coffee {_?_} .", "options": ["pause", "lull", "letup", "respite", "break", "interlude", "intermission", "recess"], "answer": "break"}, {"question": "the {_?_} that refreshes .", "options": ["pause", "lull", "letup", "respite", "break", "interlude", "intermission", "recess"], "answer": "pause"}, {"question": "a {_?_} in the bombing ;

And it may involve getting free from some restraint or enclosure . < Burst >  is close to break in this latter sense but involves much greater violence . It is a highly specific verb , suggesting a forceful breaking open that is due to internal pressure . < Crack >  usually means break without separation of parts . It suggests the breaking out across a surface of slitlike openings or hairline ruptures , either because of wear , age , or pressure . In other uses , however , crack may mean break apart or break into pieces . < Fracture >  can suggest a deeper , more thorough , but also more localized breaking than crack . < Shatter >  and < shiver >  most often suggest a total breaking up of a thin surface . Shatter is the more general of the two , implying the breaking of such a surface into sharp pieces or jagged fragments . Shatter can , however , refer to the breaking of any brittle object , in which case , it suggests reduction to many fairly small pieces . Shiver , by contrast , is more closely restricted to glass or glasslike surfaces , suggesting a reduction into long , narrow shards or stivers . Shiver might now seem outdated except as a noun meaning fragment or splinter . < Crush >  and < smash >  suggest forceful action taken to destroy or break something .

It is applied to a noticeably short , brisk , or terse manner that may or may not be rude , depending on intent and circumstance . At worst , brusque may imply incivility , ungracious sharpness , or undue severity . < Bluff >,  by contrast , is not at all negative in tone but implies a hearty frankness -- an openness that may lack finesse but does not intend discourtesy . Bluff is used almost exclusively to describe men . The bluff man talks and laughs loudly and freely , says and does whatever he pleases with fearless good nature , and with no thought of annoying or giving pain to others . < Blunt >  is fairly close to bluff at one extreme , though it can imply only a well-meaning directness . Unlike bluff , however , blunt more often suggests a flat-footed forthrightness that verges on discourtesy . It may describe a manner of speech as well as a person . [ Shall I lie politely to you , or shall I be blunt ? Be as blunt as you like -- I won't mind your rudeness if you tell me the truth . ] At the other extreme , blunt may indicate a tactless frankness that is inconsiderate or needlessly cruel . Blunt people may say tilings they know to be disagreeable , either from a defiant indifference to the feelings of others or from the pleasure obtained in tormenting . < Abrupt >  and < curt >  both suggest an uncooperative terseness , especially in reply to a question or appeal for help . Abrupt may also imply a disconcerting directness . Curt is stronger than abrupt , implying hardness or coldness of manner as well as a willful intent to be unpleasant . < Gruff >  and < surly >  suggest bad-tempered or rude behavior , but they need not imply either straightforwardness , as in bluff and blunt , nor undue brevity of response , as in abrupt and curt . Of the two , gruff is more appropriately applied to a man and is most applicable to disposition . It describes one who is brusque , rough , and crusty in manner or hoarse and guttural in speech . Surly suggests extreme discourtesy and may be applied to either sex . It implies not so much a sour frame of mind as an abiding attitude of hostility to people -- a crabbed , churlish disposition evident in both speech and manner .

The object may be changed only slightly , or it may be totally destroyed . Although it usually connotes some degree of destruction , burning may accomplish a useful purpose . A householder bums fuel to heat the house . In autumn , gardeners formerly burned leaves to dispose of them . Not only heat but also extreme cold , corrosive chemicals , gases , electricity , radiation , friction , and the like may cause the kind of surface change or stinging sensation associated with a bum . Hence , acid is said to bum the skin , and a cutting wind may make the cheeks bum . Bum can also mean cause a feeling of heat in a part of the body . To < scald >  is to bum with a very hot liquid or steam . Thus , the careless chef may scald herself if she spills hot soup or boiling water . < Singe >, < scorch >,  and < char >  are related in that they mean bum partially , slightly , or superficially . To singe is to bum the surface or ends of something . Singeing is sometimes done deliberately , as to remove bristles or to keep hair from splitting . A cook may singe a plucked chicken to remove pinfeathers by passing the fowl through an open flame . To scorch is to bum something to the point of discoloration , usually by hot metal . Char may imply a more advanced stage of combustion . It means reduce a substance to carbon , either completely , as in charcoal , or partially . < Sear >, < brand >,  and < cauterize >  all connote deliberate burning to achieve a definite purpose . All are also used of flesh . Of the three , sear is the most general , as it can mean both brand and cauterize . Searing involves subjecting a surface to intense heat for a very short time . This may have the effect of hardening , sealing , drying up , destroying tissue , or leaving an ineradicable imprint . To brand is to sear with a hot iron , burning a mark into the flesh , as to signify ownership . A rancher brands cattle so that drey can be identified when they stray or are stolen . To cauterize is to sear tissue with a caustic agent or heated iron for curative purposes .

Brown is busy right now ; The line is busy . ] Or it may imply constant , concentrated involvement in business , or intensive and varied activity of any kind . The effort involved in being or staying busy , by implication , may be valuable or productive . But in some cases , busy gives a special overtone of empty fuss and hollow results . Another special use refers disapprovingly to a distracting elaborateness of design . < Active >  stresses action , operation , or involvement as opposed to passivity or dormancy . Active accounts are productive , and active investments yield interest . An active volcano is not extinct but may erupt , though it seldom does . Used of persons , active often points to actual work or participation as contrasted with mere approval or association . A soldier on active duty is involved in military service full-time , but may not be busy all the time . Active may also mean brisk or lively , suggesting a heaviness of traffic or transactions . < Occupied >  shares with busy and active a simple contrast with idle . When used of a person , it suggests involvement with a specific task . When used of an object , it suggests its physical use at that moment . A telephone line can be busy but cannot be occupied . Conversely , a telephone booth can be occupied but cannot be busy . Occupied , when used of someone's mental state , means absorbed in thought , either purposive or idle . In either case , it can suggest concentration to the point of distraction . < Engrossed >  compares closely with this special use of occupied , implying even greater concentration , but with the added suggestion of pleasurable , willing , or fascinated involvement . < Engaged >  suggests involvement , like busy , but implies concentration on a specific task , like occupied .

Trait , most specifically , is used to describe abiding behavior patterns , rather than single or momentary actions . Quality is more general than any of the other nouns here ; it may suggest a passing aspect or an abiding one ; it may suggest positive or negative attributes .

It applies readily to feminine accomplishments or apparel . Used of men , it suggests sophistication and suavity . Originally , it suggested being put under a magic charm ; the force of this original meaning is still felt , perhaps , when charming refers to a beautiful scene or landscape . < Bewitching >, < enchanting >,  and < entrancing >  also once suggested being put under a magic spell . Now , used to describe an attractive woman , they do not suggest social grace so much as qualities of freshness , strangeness , or exotic allure , all considerably less innocuous than anything implied by charming . One might call the woman next door charming , for all her simplicity , but one would think twice about calling her bewitching -- unless one lived in a rather unusual neighborhood . Bewitching most strongly suggests this exotic quality ; enchanting , through overuse , is more innocuous than its two companions -- shading off toward charming . Entrancing still has some of its freshness left , suggesting an ability to command an onlooker's stunned , almost hypnotized attention . The same scale of forces for these three prevails when they are used to describe scenery . None of them would be a likely description for a man . < Captivating >  and < winning >  suggest a different and fainter submerged metaphor -- of military conquest . They might both be most precisely used to imply an initial resistance on the part of the onlooker . Winning , however , suggests warm-hearted sunniness of disposition , whereas captivating carries an overtone of sexual allure and vivacity . Winning may also pertain to a single act , while captivating applies more easily to an entire manner of behavior . Both adjectives may describe men , in which case an attempted conquest of a woman is implied , winning referring to an ingratiating pleasantness of manner and captivating to a rakish insouciance . Winning would have little use in describing scenery , but captivating might suggest a collection of fanciful qualities that sweeps one away in spite of one's distrust for the strange or unusual . < Fascinating >  has perhaps suffered less from overuse as a superlative than these other adjectives . Although more general in application , it still can suggest , like entrancing , a prospect that is almost hypnotic in its inviting quality . It applies to men as well as to women , to any attractive scene or view , or to any idea or thing that is extremely interesting .

Circumlocution , being slightly more common , has gathered more connotations ; it can suggest avoidance of direct statement out of squeamishness , insincerity , self-interest , or a misplaced desire for elegance .

Surround , however , often emphasizes an undesirable , hostile , or dangerous circumscribing . Surround can , of course , be used without negative implications . < Encircle >  is closest to surround in its generality , but it suggests a tighter cluster about a central object and most often indicates a deliberate grouping for a definite reason .

It suggests a succinct fisting of the details that support a case , although each detail might be sketched rather than developed in full . One might refer to definitive proof that the world is round , but one would have to be more specific in order to adduce the reasons why this is known to be true .

A person may explain a thing by describing its form or structure , tracing its origins and development , showing its operation or use , or citing its validity and the relations of its parts . Hence , an expert might elucidate one detail of a complex matter without explaining the whole . In its most informal sense , explain suggests a verbal attempt to justify actions or to make them understood . When explain is closer in meaning to elucidate , it may suggest a total falling into place of a causal sequence . Interpret is like explicate in suggesting a point-by-point treatment of an earlier situation , pronouncement , or event so that it can be understood ; it is like elucidate in implying the use of knowledge or insight to cast light on some baffling problem or puzzle , though it differs in stressing personal judgment or understanding .

Less concretely , clean can refer to an absence of fault or failing that combines in some uses with its reference to the absence of marks , implying a place where faults might otherwise be marked down in a list . Clean's implications of purity further extend to the moral sense , referring to that which is innocent , especially of sexual impropriety . Clean , however , can refer simply to what is well intended and harmless . < Fresh >  is often used in apposition with clean to emphasize newness or lack of use as well as purity . It may also suggest something revivifying in its purity . Used in reference to failings , it suggests not an absence of faults but the putting aside of past mistakes . < Spotless >  refers to an actual absence of marks or blemishes . It is , however , more emphatic than clean and carries implications of neatness and tidiness as well . Otherwise , spotless may simply be a hyperbolic substitute for clean , though it may differ in describing something never sullied . < Stainless >  may be used in a way closely resembling spotless .

Similarly , < inept >  refers less to physical movement than to an abject and total failure to accomplish a desired result . < Ungainly >  specifically suggests a lack of grace that may or may not result , like awkward , from some innate misproportion . < Gawky >  is much more emphatic about the physical basis for awkward or ungainly action ; it may specifically suggest long , thin , or attenuated limbs . < Lumbering >,  by contrast , suggests ungraceful physical misproportion that stems from an overly heavy or outsized build .", "questionList": [{"question": "a {_?_} walk ; her ____ attempt to match the colors of the original ; a ____ sweep of his hand that sent the vase toppling ; the ____ dialogue of the play .", "options": ["lumbering", "clumsy", "ungainly", "gawky", "bungling", "awkward", "inept"], "answer": "clumsy"}, {"question": "a ____ walk ; her {_?_} attempt to match the colors of the original ; a ____ sweep of his hand that sent the vase toppling ; the ____ dialogue of the play .", "options": ["lumbering", "clumsy", "ungainly", "gawky", "bungling", "awkward", "inept"], "answer": "clumsy"}, {"question": "a ____ walk ; her ____ attempt to match the colors of the original ; a {_?_} sweep of his hand that sent the vase toppling ; the ____ dialogue of the play .", "options": ["lumbering", "clumsy", "ungainly", "gawky", "bungling", "awkward", "inept"], "answer": "clumsy"}, {"question": "a ____ walk ; her ____ attempt to match the colors of the original ; a ____ sweep of his hand that sent the vase toppling ; the {_?_} dialogue of the play .", "options": ["lumbering", "clumsy", "ungainly", "gawky", "bungling", "awkward", "inept"], "answer": "clumsy"}, {"question": "an {_?_} build ; an ____ grammatical construction ; a mutual suspicion that made for ____ silences in their talk ; shyness that left him flustered and ____ .", "options": ["lumbering", "clumsy", "ungainly", "gawky", "bungling", "awkward", "inept"], "answer": "awkward"}, {"question": "an ____ build ; an {_?_} grammatical construction ; a mutual suspicion that made for ____ silences in their talk ; shyness that left him flustered and ____ .", "options": ["lumbering", "clumsy", "ungainly", "gawky", "bungling", "awkward", "inept"], "answer": "awkward"}, {"question": "an ____ build ; an ____ grammatical construction ; a mutual suspicion that made for {_?_} silences in their talk ; shyness that left him flustered and ____ .", "options": ["lumbering", "clumsy", "ungainly", "gawky", "bungling", "awkward", "inept"], "answer": "awkward"}, {"question": "an ____ build ; an ____ grammatical construction ; a mutual suspicion that made for ____ silences in their talk ; shyness that left him flustered and {_?_} .", "options": ["lumbering", "clumsy", "ungainly", "gawky", "bungling", "awkward", "inept"], "answer": "awkward"}, {"question": "One student's work is sensitive but still {_?_}", "options": ["lumbering", "clumsy", "ungainly", "gawky", "bungling", "awkward", "inept"], "answer": "awkward"}, {"question": "the others are without exception hopelessly {_?_} .", "options": ["lumbering", "clumsy", "ungainly", "gawky", "bungling", "awkward", "inept"], "answer": "clumsy"}, {"question": "his {_?_} mismanagement of the whole affair .", "options": ["lumbering", "clumsy", "ungainly", "gawky", "bungling", "awkward", "inept"], "answer": "bungling"}, {"question": "a completely {_?_} attempt at humor ; an ____ movie .", "options": ["lumbering", "clumsy", "ungainly", "gawky", "bungling", "awkward", "inept"], "answer": "inept"}, {"question": "a completely ____ attempt at humor ; an {_?_} movie .", "options": ["lumbering", "clumsy", "ungainly", "gawky", "bungling", "awkward", "inept"], "answer": "inept"}, {"question": "an {_?_} attempt to retrieve the fallen napkin ; an ____ body incapable of agile movement .", "options": ["lumbering", "clumsy", "ungainly", "gawky", "bungling", "awkward", "inept"], "answer": "ungainly"}, {"question": "an ____ attempt to retrieve the fallen napkin ; an {_?_} body incapable of agile movement .", "options": ["lumbering", "clumsy", "ungainly", "gawky", "bungling", "awkward", "inept"], "answer": "ungainly"}, {"question": "the usual {_?_} adolescent .", "options": ["lumbering", "clumsy", "ungainly", "gawky", "bungling", "awkward", "inept"], "answer": "gawky"}, {"question": "the big brute who lumbered after me down the stairs ; the slow pace of the {_?_} play .", "options": ["lumbering", "clumsy", "ungainly", "gawky", "bungling", "awkward", "inept"], "answer": "lumbering"}]}, {"wordSetString": "clutter,disarray,confusion,chaos,disorder", "original_discussion": "All these nouns mean a lack of order and arrangement . < Clutter >  implies that objects are jumbled together in heaps , while < disorder >  means they are not in their normal places .

In reference to temperature , < cold >  may refer to something desirably low-key . Aside from this situation , however , cold more often connotes an unpleasantly low temperature . < Frigid >  and < frosty >  are intensifications of cold , specifically referring to temperatures below freezing . Frigid factually stresses something that has been frozen solid or a temperature enabling this . Frosty may suggest a slightly warmer temperature , one at which frost first begins to form or breath vapor can be seen . Like frigid , < gelid >  and < icy >  imply a temperature cold enough to result in the production of ice . Icy may also be merely a hyperbole for cold . In reference to temperature , < cool >  often suggests something pleasant or mildly low-key . < Chilled >  refers to someone who has become cold or something that has been caused to turn cool . < Chilly >,  by contrast , refers more often to air or weather midway between cool and cold . Chilly , in fact , may suggest an erratic coming and going of cold winds . When these adjectives refer to emotional states , their interrelations differ . Cold may refer to an unresponsive attitude or , more drastically , to hostility . In their greater intensity , frosty and icy usually stress the hostility implicit in cold . Frigid , however , is now so often used specifically of sexual unresponsiveness in women that it may sound odd or comic in any other emotional context . Cool suggests reserve based on shyness , lack of enthusiasm , or disapproval . It may also suggest an ability to remain objective or impartial or to avoid anger or panic . Chilly suggests manners that are standoffish or openly hostile . Chilled , by contrast , pertains mostly to a discouraged or horrified reaction to something else .

Even here , relief is more restricted to expressing the mere absence of negative elements , whereas comfort might suggest replacing them with something positive . < Ease >  and < relaxation >  refer exclusively to positive states and so relate to a side of comfort in contrast to simple relief . Ease has the widest range of any of these nouns , referring to things that make for contentment , like comfort , but going beyond it to suggest utter naturalness , lack of tension , or profound mental and physical peacefulness . Relaxation is much more limited in reference than ease ; it refers particularly to a state of freedom from or dwindling away of tension .

Of these , command is the more formal and more general ; it may pertain to an overall plan that is to be executed , whereas order might pertain more to a limited action or to a detailed part of such a plan . In addition , command is more forceful , peremptory , and less impersonal . But command can refer to a position of control . < Directive >  and < injunction >  are considerably more formal than the foregoing and are much more limited and specific in their application . Injunction now pertains mostly to a legal context , where it indicates a court order that is backed by the threat of punishment for disobedience . An injunction often takes the form of a command to refrain from a specified action . Directive refers to orders , often detailed at length , that those in command send down through channels to gain the compliance of all affected personnel . Where the previous nouns can suggest either oral or written statements , directive most often suggests written guidelines for action . Directive can seem to apply euphemistically to advice that carries no explicit threat of punishment for disobedience , but the rulings of a directive are usually mandatory and beyond appeal . < Direction >  and < instruction >  both have applications referring to orders that may not be contravened ; in this sense both are extremely formal . Direction would suggest a less detailed oral or written statement than directive ; it is also less forceful and more euphemistic in tone . Often it can apply to informative but mandatory guidelines . In the context of orders , instruction stresses that a desired action cannot be done without including the necessary information as part of the command . When the giving of information is not suggested by instruction , it can be even more euphemistic than direction . The last pair of nouns pertain more often and less formally to the giving of knowledgeable advice or guidance . In the plural , both can indicate a programmatic or diagrammatic plan for a relatively complicated action that one wishes or chooses to perform . Directions would be more appropriate for a one-time action , instructions for an action one may wish to learn by heart or perform more than once . Direction can apply , of course , to information about reaching a place .

Element comes from a Latin root meaning first principle ; this is reflected in its use to indicate the rudiments of a subject .

Dumbfound implies an acute emotional shock that leaves one speechless ; nonplus suggests a more intellectual surprise at some irrational incongruence , leaving one unable to think clearly for a moment .", "questionList": [{"question": "detailed directions that only served to {_?_} me further ; ____ by his sudden swings between exuberance and depression .", "options": ["bewilder", "dumbfound", "nonplus", "confuse", "confound"], "answer": "confuse"}, {"question": "detailed directions that only served to ____ me further ; {_?_} by his sudden swings between exuberance and depression .", "options": ["bewildered", "dumbfounded", "nonplused", "confused", "confounded"], "answer": "confused"}, {"question": "completely {_?_} by the crossfire of conflicting commands by his parents .", "options": ["bewildered", "dumbfounded", "nonplused", "confused", "confounded"], "answer": "bewildered"}, {"question": "She was so {_?_} by his accusations that she sat down and cried .", "options": ["bewildered", "dumbfounded", "nonplused", "confused", "confounded"], "answer": "bewildered"}, {"question": "an appeal for help that was utterly {_?_} by red tape and bureaucratic double-talk .", "options": ["bewildered", "dumbfounded", "nonplused", "confused", "confounded"], "answer": "confounded"}, {"question": "The boy was {_?_} at his mother's insistence that he explain where every penny of his allowance had gone ; nonplussed by the strange costumes they saw everywhere in the bohemian section of the city .", "options": ["bewildered", "dumbfounded", "nonplused", "confused", "confounded"], "answer": "dumbfounded"}]}, {"wordSetString": "consent,concur,acquiesce,assent,subscribe,agree", "original_discussion": "These verbs refer to a positive response or to a congruence between or among things . < Consent >  is restricted to the giving of permission or the accepting of a proposal or request . Consent always implies the power not to consent . Where consent often implies the permission of a superior , < assent >  can indicate the approval of an equal . Assent , furthermore , is most often limited to an affirmative response to a statement or opinion . < Acquiesce >  suggests either lukewarm or minimal compliance or a compliance compelled by outside force or circumstances . In the latter case , acquiesce does not suggest the uncompromised freedom to choose that is inherent in the previous verbs . < Agree >  is much wider in its application than the previous verbs . It can apply , like consent , to a positive response . But agree can also indicate congruence of opinion that does not involve statement and response , or even previous negotiation or discussion . In its widest use , agree can indicate things that are alike . < Concur >  is restricted to statements , findings , or opinions , but otherwise can indicate , like agree , positions that are found to be alike . More often , however , concur refers to a common position reached by serious deliberation or negotiation . Concur can also indicate agreeing to a position already taken by another or others . < Subscribe >  indicates wholehearted approval for an already formulated position .

It suggests greater urgency and , in contrast to conserve , may suggest that the item in question is literally impossible to replace once it is gone . < Maintain >  and < save >  relate somewhat in the manner of conserve and preserve . Maintain , like conserve , emphasizes careful use and replenishment of a quantity , but suggests that a steady routine of work will be enough to keep the item in its present state . Maintain also does not necessarily suggest something of great value ; it can pertain to anything one wishes to keep in good working condition . Save , on the other hand , is somewhat more like preserve , suggesting greater urgency and the irreplaceability of what might otherwise be lost . If anything , it is more urgent ( and certainly more informal ) than preserve , especially in its sense of rescue . In an informal context , however , it can function exactly like the more formal conserve . Where it is distinct from all the verbs so far discussed is in suggesting the accumulating of a quantity . Both conserve and preserve concentrate on what one already has ; maintain emphasizes the taking in and giving out to keep an unchanging balance . Save , however , can suggest the adding of new quantities to what already exists . < Store >  and < hoard >  relate to this last meaning of save . Store suggests the piling up of goods that may be bulkier than those suggested by save , but as with save , the stored item may be valuable or worthless , may be stored for future use -- or for no purpose whatsoever .

It would seldom suggest , in fact , that a question of satiation exists , and may have more to do with the expression of mild approval .", "questionList": [{"question": "{_?_} cows ; She pampered him so that he would feel thoroughly ____ .", "options": ["content", "contented", "gratified", "satisfied", "pleased"], "answer": "contented"}, {"question": "____ cows ; She pampered him so that he would feel thoroughly {_?_} .", "options": ["content", "contented", "gratified", "satisfied", "pleased"], "answer": "contented"}, {"question": "peasants who were thought to be {_?_} with their humble station in fife ; The reporter appeared ____ with the brief interview he was granted .", "options": ["content", "contented", "gratified", "satisfied", "pleased"], "answer": "content"}, {"question": "peasants who were thought to be ____ with their humble station in fife ; The reporter appeared {_?_} with the brief interview he was granted .", "options": ["content", "contented", "gratified", "satisfied", "pleased"], "answer": "content"}, {"question": "gorging himself until he felt almost uncomfortably {_?_} .", "options": ["content", "contented", "gratified", "satisfied", "pleased"], "answer": "satisfied"}, {"question": "dull , {_?_} faces ; ____ with his score on the exam .", "options": ["content", "contented", "gratified", "satisfied", "pleased"], "answer": "contented"}, {"question": "dull , ____ faces ; {_?_} with his score on the exam .", "options": ["content", "contented", "gratified", "satisfied", "pleased"], "answer": "satisfied"}, {"question": "a longing for excitement that was only fully {_?_} when he moved to the big city .", "options": ["content", "contented", "gratified", "satisfied", "pleased"], "answer": "gratified"}, {"question": "{_?_} at the way her students took up the challenges she laid down .", "options": ["content", "contented", "gratified", "satisfied", "pleased"], "answer": "gratified"}, {"question": "{_?_} with the refreshing simplicity of the fight snack .", "options": ["content", "contented", "gratified", "satisfied", "pleased"], "answer": "pleased"}, {"question": "She was {_?_} at the courteous way in which he addressed her .", "options": ["content", "contented", "gratified", "satisfied", "pleased"], "answer": "pleased"}]}, {"wordSetString": "oppose,controvert,deny,contradict,contravene,gainsay,disprove,refute", "original_discussion": "These verbs refer to the rejection of a previous statement by argument or evidence . < Contradict >  may indicate no more than disagreement with a statement . In this case , no attempt at proof may be involved . Contradict also applies to an obvious discrepancy between statements or things where no proof is necessary . In its widest application , < deny >  can point to something refused or withheld . In the context of disputes , deny often suggests the specific situation of giving a negative answer to a charge or accusation . < Gainsay >  is more formal and is now rarely used in speech ; it does suggest that someone gives vocal dissent to an opinion or accusation , perhaps arbitrarily , tersely , or abruptly , without supporting arguments . Gainsay most often appears now with a negative . Here , something is presented as so convincing or conclusive that an arbitrary rejection is not possible . < Oppose >  is far less formal in tone than gainsay and applies widely beyond the context of dispute or argument . It can suggest unreasoning enmity to a position , with no attempt to argue or present evidence . Oppose can also suggest reasoned disagreement . < Contravene >  can function like contradict when it points to a discrepancy between statements or things , especially where one entity conflicts with another . In terms of argument , contravene may point to an attempt to overthrow a whole trend of thought by making telling points . The previous verbs are mainly concerned with situations in which one statement is at odds with another . The remaining verbs all can indicate the situation in which a statement or position is demolished by facts or evidence . < Disprove >  is the most forceful of these , indicating that a statement , proposition , theory , or even something accepted as a fact has been demonstrated as untrue by countering evidence . When two scientific theories contradict each other , for example , further investigation will sooner or later disprove one or the other or both , whether in whole or in part . < Controvert >,  a more formal term , points to someone who opposes a given view and wishes to disprove it by offering evidence . When contrasted with contravene , the emphasis of controvert falls more heavily on proof . < Refute >  can suggest the successful demolishing of an argument by reasoning alone , but it applies even more forcefully when supporting evidence is suggested .", "questionList": [{"question": "He flatly {_?_} her assertion that he was too lazy to mow the lawn .", "options": ["opposed", "controverted", "denied", "contradicted", "contravened", "gainsaid", "disproved", "refuted"], "answer": "contradicted"}, {"question": "parents who {_?_} each other when giving orders to their children .", "options": ["oppose", "controvert", "deny", "contradict", "contravene", "gainsay", "disprove", "refute"], "answer": "contradict"}, {"question": "The findings of the two studies {_?_} each other", "options": ["oppose", "controvert", "deny", "contradict", "contravene", "gainsay", "disprove", "refute"], "answer": "contradict"}, {"question": "His voting record {_?_} his claim to be a liberal .", "options": ["opposes", "controverts", "denies", "contradicts", "contravenes", "gainsays", "disproves", "refutes"], "answer": "contradicts"}, {"question": "{_?_} his request for a week-end pass ;

The term < contradictory >  refers to things that mutually exclude each other , so that both cannot exist in the same object at the same time , for example , life and death . In formal logic , two statements are contradictory if they cannot both be true and cannot both be false . In other words , the statements are so related that if one is true the other must be false , as I am an American and I am not an American . < Contrary >  statements , on the other hand , cannot both be true , but they can both be false , as I am an Italian and I am a Frenchman . The falsity of either contrary statement proves nothing about the other , but the truth of one establishes the falsity of the other . In a general sense , contrary points to a basic difference in essence or disagreement in purpose or aim . Things are contrary when the highest degree of both cannot exist in the same object at the same time , but where a middle term is possible , partaking of the qualities of both . Thus , wisdom and folly are contrary , for the perfection of either excludes any trace of the other ; yet most human acts and statements partake of both . Loosely , contradictory may mean no more than differing significantly . In this sense , contradictory and < conflicting >  are often interchangeable . Conflicting means clashing and stresses discord , implying mutual antagonism , as of interests , feelings , or ideas . < Opposite >  comes close to contradictory in referring to things that are diametrically different in tendency , character , or point of view . But opposite is more likely to be applied to a difference in direction , position , or condition than to mutually exclusive statements . Where opposite refers to position , tendency , or the like , < opposed >  is chiefly used of feeling and intent . People who live on opposite sides of a fence may or may not be opposed . Contrary and opposed are often used interchangeably to mean differing from in any way . In other uses , contrary suggests active opposition , and opposed implies passive contrariness . A person holding a contrary point of view may propose that a different line of action be taken . But a person may be opposed to a line of action without proposing any alternative . Both contradictory and contrary may be used to describe persons who perversely beg to differ at every possible opportunity .", "questionList": [{"question": "a {_?_} viewpoint .", "options": ["opposed", "opposite", "contrary", "conflicting", "contradictory"], "answer": "contrary"}, {"question": "{_?_} versions of an accident .", "options": ["opposed", "opposite", "contrary", "conflicting", "contradictory"], "answer": "contradictory"}, {"question": "{_?_} opinions of the intent of the Bill of Rights ; The prospect of a return to his home town filled him with ____ emotions .", "options": ["opposed", "opposite", "contrary", "conflicting", "contradictory"], "answer": "conflicting"}, {"question": "____ opinions of the intent of the Bill of Rights ; The prospect of a return to his home town filled him with {_?_} emotions .", "options": ["opposed", "opposite", "contrary", "conflicting", "contradictory"], "answer": "conflicting"}, {"question": "{_?_} opinions ; the ____ sex .", "options": ["opposed", "opposite", "contrary", "conflicting", "contradictory"], "answer": "opposite"}, {"question": "____ opinions ; the {_?_} sex .", "options": ["opposed", "opposite", "contrary", "conflicting", "contradictory"], "answer": "opposite"}, {"question": "The condition {_?_} to cold is heat", "options": ["opposed", "opposite", "contrary", "conflicting", "contradictory"], "answer": "opposite"}, {"question": "The direction {_?_} to north is south", "options": ["opposed", "opposite", "contrary", "conflicting", "contradictory"], "answer": "opposite"}, {"question": "Black and white are often said to be {_?_} .", "options": ["opposed", "opposite", "contrary", "conflicting", "contradictory"], "answer": "opposite"}, {"question": "to do something that is {_?_} ( or ____ ) to another person's wishes .", "options": ["opposed", "opposite", "contrary", "conflicting", "contradictory"], "answer": "contrary"}, {"question": "to do something that is ____ ( or {_?_} ) to another person's wishes .", "options": ["opposed", "opposite", "contrary", "conflicting", "contradictory"], "answer": "opposed"}]}, {"wordSetString": "manage,control,govern,supervise,administer,regulate,rule,direct", "original_discussion": "The verb < control >  means exercise a restraining or dominating influence over a person or thing . < Regulate >  means order or control by rule , method , or established mode . A major stockholder may control a large block of shares in a company . The police may attempt to control an unruly mob . The Securities and Exchange Commission regulates stock-exchange activity . A government may regulate its balance-of-trade payments by controlling exports . < Direct >  stresses guidance and refers to the exercise of leadership . Direct may refer specifically to the control or conduct of affairs . In this sense , it is close to < manage >,  which emphasizes operational control . Of the two verbs , however , direct implies a stronger , overall control , while manage often refers to the actual running or handling of specific affairs and may imply delegated authority . The President directs the nation's foreign policy . A person may be hired to manage a business for the owner . The verb < administer >  implies official management and direction of affairs . It indicates the performing of executive functions and may be used of government or institutional officials . The chief of a government agency administers the funds allotted to the agency . The chancellor or president of a university may administer the school's financial affairs . In a strictly legal sense , administer means act as an executor or trustee in settling or managing an estate . To < supervise >  an operation or an employee is to be in charge of assigning , directing , and inspecting the work done . Like direct , supervise involves oversight and guidance , but it indicates a more personal control than administer , and , like manage , may imply the exercise either of personal or of delegated authority . A school superintendent may supervise the work done by the custodial staff . An office manager may supervise the work of several departments . To < govern >  is to control by authority , arbitrarily or constitutionally . Govern implies the exercise of knowledge and judgment as well as power , and usually involves systematic administration . To < rule >  is more autocratic than to govern , implying the exercise of absolute or dictatorial power and the imposition of arbitrary commands . In a democracy , an administration governs with the consent of the majority . A dictator , by contrast , may rule ( or govern ) with an iron hand .

Controversy is generally applied to disagreements between groups , such as nations , political parties , or religious sects . Internationally , one speaks of the controversy over disarmament ; politically , of the controversy over federal versus state power ; and religiously , of the controversy over priestly celibacy . Discord is controversy carried to unpleasant lengths and implies an unlikelihood of easy resolution . Discord between branches of a family often lasts for generations . Dissension is factional discord and is often expressed in voluble protests or accusations . < Argument >, < debate >,  and < dispute >  mean verbal expressions of disagreement . An argument is usually between individuals and suggests a combined appeal to reason and to emotions . It may or may not result in a resolution of the disagreement . A debate is an argument between selected individuals or groups , and is carefully controlled and monitored ; it is normally limited to an appeal to reason and is usually an attempt to arrive at the truth rather than to overpower by tricks of oratory . A dispute is an argument carried on over a long period of time and is often marked by heated clashes . < Contention >, < friction >, < conflict >,  and < strife >  mean disagreement carried so far as to be marked by ill will and sometimes by hostile actions . Contention is usually limited to verbal discord carried to extreme lengths and implies vying for a contested goal . Contention between rival camps at a political convention is often acrimonious . Friction implies a continuing disagreement between individuals or groups and is characterized by frequent clashes . Friction between labor and management can result in mutual recriminations , strikes , and lockouts . Conflict implies a disagreement so violent that resolution by action other than verbal must be resorted to . Strife implies a conflict so basic and contestants so implacable that it is characterized by continuous hostility and an uncompromising attitude . . < Bickering >, < quarrel >,  and < wrangle >  mean argument about petty matters , usually carried on in a petulant manner . These nouns may be applied to individuals or groups , and carry a suggestion of opprobrium . Bickering suggests a prolonged exchange of ill-tempered remarks . Quarrel is more general in application ; it is usually highly personal and can range from a mild verbal dispute to a violent argument .

Conversation , of course , can and does take place at extremely formal gatherings , but in this case it points to incidental exchanges that are not usually the main point of such occasions . Much more often the tone of conversation suggests a relaxed , informal atmosphere , either festive or intimate . Any situation , however , in which two or more people speak to each other at some length can constitute a conversation . When discussion indicates formal or arranged situations , it still suggests a rambling or free-wheeling meeting in which people express their views or sentiments to each other . Discussion can point specifically to a period that follows some sort of one-sided presentation , one during which audience reaction is heard . When discussion suggests an even more informal situation , it still differs from conversation in indicating a purposeful approach that Emits itself to a given theme , possibly to arrive at conclusions or determine a course of action . < Dialogue >  and < colloquy >  are more formal than the previous nouns , particularly the latter . Dialogue can refer to speeches in a play or to essays in play form . In the context of conversation , it suggests a two-person exchange , yet this distinction is commonly ignored . Dialogue has recently come to mean arranged discussions among people of dissimilar views . Colloquy is an extremely formal substitute for discussion and is typically used of formal situations . It may refer to a high-level arranged conference . It might also be used humorously to suggest guarded verbal exchanges . < Talk >  is both relatively informal and very general . It can serve as an informal substitute for conversation , with greater emphasis on intimacy , sincerity , and frankness . It can also refer to the substance of conversations or discussions . Talk can also refer informally to a one-sided presentation , as a speech or a lecture . Sometimes , talk is a more general substitute for gossip . < Chat >  and < tete-a-tete >  are emphatic about the informality and intimacy of the conversation they point to . But chat , the most informal of all these nouns , can refer to two or more people and most strongly suggests light , pleasant , and rambling talk in which personal matters , if touched on , are pursued without great intensity . By contrast , tete-a-tete specifically indicates a talk between two people ( literally , head-to-head ) , in which the emphasis is on sincerity and frankness of a confidential , romantic , or even conspiratorial sort .", "questionList": [{"question": "a party at which {_?_} flowed easily ;

It is neutral in tone and is equally suitable in common , medical , or criminological parlance . < Body >  is substituted for corpse in common speech when the latter is felt to be brutally blunt . Because body is both simple and factual , however , it does not give a euphemistic tone . One would certainly speak to someone bereaved about the body , not about the corpse . Where considerations for the feelings of others is not an issue , corpse is more exact , since body can , of course , refer to the living as well as the dead . In this neutral context , on the other hand , body might still be more appropriate than corpse for the recently dead . < Cadaver >,  most specifically , refers to a corpse used for medical education or research , excluding those examined in an autopsy merely to determine the cause of death . Cadaver may be used of nonhuman animals slated for medical dissection as well as of human bodies . Outside this medical context , cadaver would have overtones of grisliness or gallows humor . < Remains >,  in one context , is a euphemism used by undertakers who evidently consider body too indelicate to mention . This use intends , perhaps , to distinguish between the surviving soul or spirit and the physical part it leaves behind . Remains is more accurately descriptive of a corpse that has been partially destroyed -- as in an explosion or other catastrophe .

In reference to resemblance , it suggests a precise or near likeness . In reference to completion , it suggests two things that form an entity . In reference to correspondence , counterpart particularly suggests one of a matching pair of things that are alike but opposite . In this last sense < opposite number >  is sometimes used , but unlike counterpart it need indicate no likeness in appearance , only in function . An opposite number is a person or thing that corresponds to another in terms of relation of each to the sets of which they are part . In some instances opposite numbers may be physically opposed , as linemen in a football game ; in others they may simply play similar roles , as third basemen of two opposing teams . Two account executives of different advertising agencies competing for the same account may be called opposite numbers or counterparts . It is to be noted that when the opposition becomes more a matter of role than of physical position , counterpart comes into play as a synonym for opposite number . But counterpart is in any event more elevated in tone . < Correlate >  indicates a much closer relationship than counterpart , but need not imply likeness at all . It indicates instead interdependence or reciprocity , with or without the suggestion that one of two things is a cause of the other . Correlate can , however , suggest one of two similar things , each existing in mutually exclusive areas ; in this case any notion of causality is distinctly absent . < Parallel >  is related to this last sense of correlate , but , in this case , a slighter resemblance may be suggested ; again , no causality is implied . Parallel can point to a more essential likeness , correspondence , or match , but the word's clear reference to the geometric situation of lines that run equidistant to each other gives strong implications of kinship but not of close contact or causality . Parallel , however , is the one term here that readily suggests similarity between several things , rather than just two . Of all the nouns treated here , < complement >  puts the least stress on likeness and similarity ; in fact , none at all need be suggested by complement . Instead , complement points to one of two things that together make up a whole . These two things , furthermore , need not be equal halves or mirror images as is the case with counterpart .

Someone who designs dresses , cars , or stage sets may simply execute the plans for these products , leaving their actual construction to lesser artisans . Thus , design emphasizes conception rather than building . Also , it suggests a less profound change from raw material to finished product than create . Compose , most specifically , refers to musical composition . In this sense , it is more like create than design .

Because of the wide range of possibility of make , a more specific word is sometimes preferable . < Invent >  in a scientific or technological context is parallel to design in its aesthetic context .

The original mind , slipping free of the conventional and the commonplace , comes up with things no one else has thought of -- the new idea , the different approach . The creative mind goes further , combining the fruits of experience and imagination in an original way to recreate reality in a new form . Where creative and original describe the mind , creative and < imaginative >  have to do with the imagination . Great literary works are produced by the creative imagination , but the creators of such works and the works themselves are called imaginative , not creative . Creative , when applied to people and what they do , makes an elementary distinction . The creative people in an advertising agency are artists and writers , as distinguished from bookkeepers and sales personnel . Creative writing is the writing of fiction or poetry , as distinguished from the writing of fact or opinion . But creative is also used pretentiously in advertising lingo to mean novel , new , or different . Imaginative and < inventive >  are alike in indicating an active fancy , a nimble exercise of mind , and both apply to works that are strikingly original . But where the imaginative person may visualize things very different from reality , the inventive person figures out how to put things together in a new way so that they will work . Inventiveness is a practical kind of creativity . It calls into play analytical qualities of mind , often in the service of a common-sense idea of what is needed . The < resourceful >  mind solves its problems despite limitations , finding whatever means are available and adapting them to its ends . Where an inventive mind poses its own problems , a resourceful mind copes with externally imposed problems . An imaginative child may express himself or herself by drawing . An inventive child may do wonders with an Erector Set . A resourceful child may drape an old sheet over a card table to make a playhouse . Imposed limitations are not always implied by resourceful , however . Faced with the same abundance of toys , one child still might become easily bored ; a resourceful child , by contrast , might soon begin to develop new games , using untried combinations of these elements . The < ingenious >  person is both inventive and resourceful , but above all brilliantly clever . Ingenious may , in fact , sometimes suggest a superficial cleverness indulged in for its own sake , without a cause . But ingenious is more often complimentary , an expression of admiring surprise at an ability to solve a problem neatly in a highly original way .

On an informal level , < proclaim >  can indicate the declaring of a considered and definite decision or judgment . Pertaining to official utterance , proclaim stresses extreme formality . It can also indicate resolute conviction . < Enunciate >  carries over its reference to clear speech when it applies to official statements , since here it stresses the careful but authoritative spelling out of detailed rules or doctrine . The remaining terms all now pertain primarily to the dissemination of information through various communication media . < Publish >  pertains to books , magazines , newspapers , and other print media . < Broadcast >  once referred merely to making something known far and wide , but more often now pertains to anything programmed on radio or television or announced over a public-address system . < Advertise >  now indicates a paid presentation to win popularity for a product or candidate . Unlike publish and broadcast , however , advertise can suggest every conceivable medium in which paid messages can appear . A company may advertise its products by means of newspapers , magazines , television , billboards , even skywriting .", "questionList": [{"question": "She {_?_} that she did n't want to see him again .", "options": ["advertised", "broadcast", "broadcasted", "enunciated", "declared", "published", "announced", "proclaimed"], "answer": "declared"}, {"question": "The judges {_?_} the contest a tie", "options": ["advertised", "broadcast", "broadcasted", "enunciated", "declared", "published", "announced", "proclaimed"], "answer": "declared"}, {"question": "The military police {_?_} the tavern off-limits .", "options": ["advertised", "broadcast", "broadcasted", "enunciated", "declared", "published", "announced", "proclaimed"], "answer": "declared"}, {"question": "I called a press conference to {_?_} my candidacy", "options": ["advertise", "broadcast", "enunciate", "declare", "publish", "announce", "proclaim"], "answer": "announce"}, {"question": "They {_?_} to the assembled guests that they were engaged to be married", "options": ["advertised", "broadcast", "broadcasted", "enunciated", "declared", "published", "announced", "proclaimed"], "answer": "announced"}, {"question": "The officials {_?_} new rules to cover the championship bout .", "options": ["advertised", "broadcast", "broadcasted", "enunciated", "declared", "published", "announced", "proclaimed"], "answer": "announced"}, {"question": "She {_?_} the dress much too daring for her .", "options": ["advertised", "broadcast", "broadcasted", "enunciated", "declared", "published", "announced", "proclaimed"], "answer": "proclaimed"}, {"question": "the ceremony at which he would officially be {_?_} archbishop .", "options": ["advertised", "broadcast", "broadcasted", "enunciated", "declared", "published", "announced", "proclaimed"], "answer": "proclaimed"}, {"question": "We {_?_} these truths to be self-evident .", "options": ["advertise", "broadcast", "enunciate", "declare", "publish", "announce", "proclaim"], "answer": "proclaim"}, {"question": "the pope who first {_?_} the doctrine of the Assumption of the Virgin .", "options": ["advertised", "broadcast", "broadcasted", "enunciated", "declared", "published", "announced", "proclaimed"], "answer": "enunciated"}]}, {"wordSetString": "dedicate,hallow,consecrate,devote", "original_discussion": "These verbs refer to a resolute commitment or a bestowing of honor , credit , reverence , or respect . < Dedicate >  can pertain to a formal or public act in which something is metaphorically assigned to the honor or credit of someone who is not its immediate creator .

Unequivocal , in contrast , is more concerned with truthfulness and with expressions free of misleading possibilities . A definite agreement made in bad faith would not be unequivocal . < Categorical >, < unqualified >,  and < unconditional >  refer to expressions reduced to the simplest statement possible , without reservations of any land .

If a critic gives unqualified approval to a play , it means he or she found every aspect of it worthwhile -- the acting , staging , sets , costumes , and dialogue -- whether or not these things are mentioned item by item in a review .

By derivation , < denomination >  is precisely directed to this concept . It comes from the Latin word for name and applies to a religious group adhering to a particular creed under a distinctive name . In its broadest sense , denomination may refer to any such group . The adjectival form , denominational , is often used in this sense as a synonym for parochial . But in a restricted sense , the noun denomination is commonly reserved for specific Protestant communions . < Church >  is interchangeable with denomination in this sense . The Methodist denomination , for example , is more often referred to as the Methodist Church . But church has a much wider range of application than denomination . In its broadest sense , it may refer to ecclesiastical organization and authority , as distinguished from secular authority . In the context of Christianity , it may designate all , or a major part , of Christendom . In its most strictly limited sense , it may refer to an individual congregation or to the building in which that congregation worships . Also , where church stresses the union of believers in one body , denomination emphasizes separateness . Hence , in an ecumenical age of interdenominational activity , denomination is less often used in its religious context than formerly . < Religion >  is a general noun embracing all systems of religious belief . It can be used to refer to the major faiths or to their larger subdivisions . Like denomination , religion may sometimes emphasize differences in belief , and in this sense it is often used with reference to Catholicism , Protestantism , and Judaism . < Sect >  may designate a smaller group within a denomination , especially one that differs from the larger body in a particular matter of faith or worship . Sect is also used derogatorily of a relatively small , unorthodox denomination , to stress its separateness or peculiarity . Sect acquired this derogatory connotation as a result of the many historical instances when sects were formed by groups that had split from their parent religion because of doctrinal discontent . The term < cult >  is often applied to the forms or followers of a religious system that is looked on with suspicion or disfavor .

Lament still has legitimate serious uses , however , to indicate sincere grief or remorse . < Mourn >  has pejorative possibilities , but it is much more commonly used to refer to serious expressions of deep loss .", "questionList": [{"question": "to {_?_} a leader's vacillating policies ; ____ the book's bad writing ; ____ the lack of support for science ; ____ the frankness of language in today's movies .", "options": ["mourn", "bemoan", "lament", "bewail", "deplore"], "answer": "deplore"}, {"question": "to ____ a leader's vacillating policies ; {_?_} the book's bad writing ; ____ the lack of support for science ; ____ the frankness of language in today's movies .", "options": ["mourning", "bemoaning", "lamenting", "bewailing", "deploring"], "answer": "deploring"}, {"question": "to ____ a leader's vacillating policies ; ____ the book's bad writing ; {_?_} the lack of support for science ; ____ the frankness of language in today's movies .", "options": ["mourning", "bemoaning", "lamenting", "bewailing", "deploring"], "answer": "deploring"}, {"question": "to ____ a leader's vacillating policies ; ____ the book's bad writing ; ____ the lack of support for science ; {_?_} the frankness of language in today's movies .", "options": ["mourning", "bemoaning", "lamenting", "bewailing", "deploring"], "answer": "deploring"}, {"question": "{_?_} and ____ their capture as though they were innocent victims .", "options": ["mourning", "bemoaning", "lamenting", "bewailing", "deploring"], "answer": "bemoaning"}, {"question": "____ and {_?_} their capture as though they were innocent victims .", "options": ["mourning", "bemoaning", "lamenting", "bewailing", "deploring"], "answer": "bewailing"}, {"question": "{_?_} the effort he had to make to support his family ; loudly ____ her husband's mistreatment of her to the neighbors .", "options": ["mourning", "bemoaning", "lamenting", "bewailing", "deploring"], "answer": "bemoaning"}, {"question": "____ the effort he had to make to support his family ; loudly {_?_} her husband's mistreatment of her to the neighbors .", "options": ["mourning", "bemoaning", "lamenting", "bewailing", "deploring"], "answer": "bewailing"}, {"question": "{_?_} the passing of the good old days .", "options": ["mourning", "bemoaning", "lamenting", "bewailing", "deploring"], "answer": "lamenting"}, {"question": "{_?_} the fact that it was her own lack of concern that had driven the boy from the house that night .", "options": ["mourning", "bemoaning", "lamenting", "bewailing", "deploring"], "answer": "lamenting"}, {"question": "the entire nation unashamedly {_?_} the loss of the great leader .", "options": ["mourning", "bemoaning", "lamenting", "bewailing", "deploring"], "answer": "mourning"}]}, {"wordSetString": "evil,nefarious,vile,heinous,degenerate,corrupt,depraved,wicked,vicious,villainous,infamous", "original_discussion": "These adjectives describe persons , qualities , or actions that are morally base , malicious , or malevolent . < Depraved >  is perhaps the most sinister . It points to utter perversion , meaning , by derivation , completely bad or totally immoral . In its most common use , it suggests a compulsive or willful turning away from the good , indicating a warped character or a twisted mind . Where depraved tends to be absolute , < degenerate >  is relative , implying a descent from a higher state or better condition . It may indicate moral , physical , or mental deterioration from a standard or norm . Since degenerate focuses on the results of degradation , however , it is commonly applied to persons or things that may never have been normal to start with . < Corrupt >  is clearer than degenerate in its implication of a lapse from a better condition , even when the resulting adulteration has totally vitiated any positive values that may originally have been present . But where degenerate is applied to low specimens of humanity , corrupt is often used of persons in high positions whose moral decay may not be apparent on the surface . < Wicked >  and < evil >  are both general words with wide application . Evil means morally bad . In an abstract sense , it is the polar opposite of good and can suggest utter and insidious malevolence . Hence , evil can be a much stronger word than wicked , which implies sinfulness and may sound old-fashioned . Wicked is now often used in a humorous , tongue-in-cheek , or even admiring way . < Vile >  suggests something noxious or loathsome in its depravity , something utterly despicable or repulsive . A corrupt official might present a pleasant or attractive appearance , but vile indicates disgusting qualities that are readily apparent . Vile may , however , be used in a looser sense as a colorful intensive of awful or terrible . [ What vile weather ! She's in a vile mood . Don't use such vile language . ] < Villainous >  suggests egregious wickedness and can be applied disapprovingly to anyone thought guilty of evil behavior . Even more than wicked , however , villainous now imparts an old-fashioned , melodramatic flavor to a denunciation . Unlike the other adjectives in this set , < infamous >  refers to notoriety and ill fame , indicating a vile reputation . It points to evil that has gained wide publicity or that deserves universal condemnation , and it may apply to a person , action , or place . < Nefarious >  is the most formal in the group and the least often encountered . It may suggest a glaring disregard for law or accepted morality , or a shocking disrespect for things that are worthy of reverence . It often has imph-cations of premeditated group activity that is clandestine and underhand . < Vicious >  calls to mind a mean , snarling animal baring its fangs and preparing to attack . It is used to describe persons , things , or ways of acting that are cruel or brutal , whether or not an evil act is intended . Vicious may also mean spiteful or malicious , as in a vicious he ; evil or depraved , as in vicious associates ; or morally injurious , as in vicious habits . < Heinous >  comes from an Old French verb meaning hate . It is applied to something so atrocious as to inspire hatred , horror , or outrage . Heinous , however , is distinctly high-flown or old-fashioned in flavor .", "questionList": [{"question": "a {_?_} sadist ; ____ tastes .", "options": ["evil", "nefarious", "vile", "heinous", "degenerate", "corrupt", "depraved", "wicked", "vicious", "villainous", "infamous"], "answer": "depraved"}, {"question": "a ____ sadist ;

It indicates the dishonoring of something sacred by wrongful use or irreverent treatment , and it commonly implies a conscious or intentional act . Specifically , desecration often points to the deliberate degrading , damaging , or destroying of a religious building or place . Outside a religious context , desecration may suggest the contemptuous abuse of anything that is held dear or regarded as sacred . < Profanation >  is milder than desecration and less commonly used . It may or may not involve physical abuse of a sacred place , but focuses on a lack of proper respect or a callous or shocking act of irreverence . Literally , profanation suggests a reduction of something sacred to the level of the secular , but it has few general uses outside the religious context . < Sacrilege >  comes from a Latin word meaning temple robber . In a theological sense , it may imply improper use of a sacrament , as by one unfit to give or receive it . In a broader sense , it often points to an irreligious or taboo act that profanes the sacred character of a person , place , or thing in a shocking way . Sacrilege is even less concrete than profanation , though , since the irreverence involved can consist of a thought as well as an act and need not occur within religious surroundings . < Defilement >  suggests the dirtying or profanation of something that should be cherished or kept pure . In a religious sense , it may indicate the act of rendering something ceremonially ( though not literally ) unclean . In a broader sense , it may indicate either a physical or spiritual sullying . < Debasement >  is less often used in a religious sense and does not suggest befouling or pollution . Instead , it focuses on a lowering in character , quality , or worth . Applied to persons , debasement may indicate a public humiliation , as through verbal attack . Like desecration and profanation , < violation >  may apply to the irreverent treatment of a sacred thing or holy place . But violation more often carries legal rather than religious connotations , suggesting the breaking of a law or a failure to abide by the terms of a binding contract . Outside this specific context , it can be used of a sexual attack .

It may also refer specifically to pessimism about the future , whether momentary or permanent . < Hopelessness >  relates exclusively to this last possibility of despair , implying a pessimism more deep-seated and long lasting . Hopelessness may also suggest that someone's present position is extremely imperiled , with or without that person's realizing it . < Discouragement >  is much milder than the other nouns of this group . It restricts itself to one possibility of despair in that it pertains almost exclusively to a feeling of letdown at some misfortune or rebuff . Discouragement most often suggests a response to the thwarting or frustration of an ongoing process or effort ; it can be momentary ( as above ) , gradual , or total . < Despondency >  also pertains to a thwarted or frustrated feeling of letdown , but it is more intense than discouragement in suggesting more strictly a sense of total defeat that is expressed in lethargy , introversion , and apathy . Despondency relates tangentially to hopelessness in that such thoroughgoing defeat as it suggests usually implies as well a feeling that the future will not improve one's situation . < Desperation >  is unique among these nouns in suggesting such an intensity of despair that one may easily be goaded into wild , blind , or reckless action as a last resort .

These three verbs particularly have a wide range of use beyond actual physical destruction . Here , destroy may suggest malevolent action that makes something impossible . Ruin points to anything that spoils or mars something good or desirable . Wreck suggests the breaking down of some cohesive unity . < Demolish >  and < raze >  are generally applied to big or substantial things , such as buildings or other edifices . A building is demolished if smashed to pieces , and razed if leveled to the ground . Demolish , unlike raze , is often used figuratively of the reduction of any complex whole to ruins . Raze is used almost invariably of buildings or their remains . < Annihilate >  is the most extreme verb in this list and literally means reduce to nothingness . As more commonly used , however , it denotes a severe degree of damage to a thing or person . An army may annihilate an enemy force by so damaging it as to render it incapable of further offensive or defensive action , but without literally removing all traces of its existence . A debater may be said to annihilate an opponent if he defeats him decisively . < Eradicate >  and < uproot >  are etymological equivalents , but differ in their applications . To eradicate weeds is not only to destroy their visible parts but to pull them out by the roots and thus prevent their reappearance . Eradicate can also mean eliminate completely . Uproot means pull up by the roots and is used figuratively as well as literally . < Exterminate >, < extinguish >,  and < extirpate >  often mean destroy purposefully .

Distinguish , consequently , stresses the skill needed for the detection of differences and , unlike discriminate , does not emphasize aesthetic evaluation as a part of the process . Distinguish , however , when it refers to characteristics of a thing perceived , is quite the opposite ; in this case , it suggests drastically different and often superior qualities . < Differentiate >,  in referring to qualities in something perceived , contrasts sharply with distinguish , suggesting slighter differences and differences seldom the result of excellence .

To be disinterested , in fact , requires attentiveness to detail and an evenness of temper without implying coldness or lack of feeling . < Fair >  is much more informal than disinterested and would be more appropriate to describe a decision or a person who makes a decision once a verdict has been rendered . Also , where disinterested stresses keeping an open mind , fair suggests the taking of a stand based on ethical considerations . < Impartial >  and < unbiased >  are more closely related to disinterested than to fair in emphasizing open-mindedness . Impartial suggests literally taking no one's part ; it implies , perhaps , a greater impersonality than disinterested . While closely related , unbiased suggests someone who is inherently free of any predispositions toward conflicting sides or parties . A person who has such predispositions might still , by putting them aside , succeed in being impartial , but being unbiased suggests he or she has no predispositions to start with . In reference to reporting , impartial might suggest uninvolvement , while unbiased would suggest a fair treatment of all sides , even though a definite point of view emerges . < Dispassionate >  and < unprejudiced >  both emphasize the control of emotions rather than of thoughts . Dispassionate suggests someone unswayed by extraneous appeals designed to excite sympathy or indignation . It is even more strikingly different from disinterested , however , in being applicable not only to an impartial judge , but to an involved contender who remains low-keyed , even-tempered , and factual in argument . Unprejudiced , in this emotional context , relates most closely to unbiased , but unprejudiced seems more fundamental and thoroughgoing , more inclusive in stressing the absence of any irrational , deeply ingrained emotional blind spot . Unprejudiced , furthermore , might suggest an inward state , while unbiased would suggest the result or proof of this state in action . One could learn to behave in an unbiased way even though not wholly unprejudiced . < Neutral >  and < objective >  both suggest an even greater distance than any of the foregoing adjectives . Neutral emphasizes the taking of no sides even to the point of rendering no final judgment whatsoever . Objective suggests an interest only in cold fact as distinct from belief , opinion , or attitude ; unlike disinterested , it may also suggest lack of feeling . Some writers would argue that objective is necessarily a relative rather than an absolute quality .

It usually refers to differences that are so extreme as to make the compared people or things totally distinct . Jekyll and Mr . Hyde . < Discordant >  suggests the unpleasant effect that is the result of an association of two or more musical sounds that are not in harmony or concord . In general application discordant can refer to anything not in agreement with any other thing , but most often it is reserved for situations that imply the presence of opposition or conflict . When people are described as discordant it is because they exist in a disagreeable , quarrelsome atmosphere . Such people may be called < incompatible >, --  that is , unable to exist or get along with each other in a pleasant or friendly way . In one way incompatible is milder than discordant ; it does not necessarily imply the open clash or opposition that discordant does . It would be possible , for example , for two people to work together in a small office without open disagreement and yet be called incompatible because one is so much more talkative than the other that he disturbs the quiet person's working habits . In another way , however , incompatible is stronger than discordant since the incompatibility of two persons or things often implies the impossibility of their coexistence . Two discordant people might stay on in a place of employment , or as part of a family unit , continually fighting but nonetheless existing together . But incompatible strongly suggests the inability to remain together . Thus , incompatible is often used to describe couples whose marriage has gone on the rocks or whose contemplated marriage is thought of as unworkable .

Cynical can also point to a readiness to be distrustful on the basis of little or no evidence . < Jaundiced >  is a more informal and colorful substitute for cynical , suggesting a hard-bitten skeptic who prefers to look at something or at everything from a negative point of view .", "questionList": [{"question": "inaccuracies in the report that made her {_?_} of its conclusions ; ____ of adults who always spoke of how much harder they had worked when they were young .", "options": ["distrustful", "disillusioned", "jaundiced", "mistrustful", "chary", "cynical"], "answer": "distrustful"}, {"question": "inaccuracies in the report that made her ____ of its conclusions ; {_?_} of adults who always spoke of how much harder they had worked when they were young .", "options": ["distrustful", "disillusioned", "jaundiced", "mistrustful", "chary", "cynical"], "answer": "distrustful"}, {"question": "increasingly {_?_} of her companion as he led the party deeper into the forest .", "options": ["distrustful", "disillusioned", "jaundiced", "mistrustful", "chary", "cynical"], "answer": "mistrustful"}, {"question": "{_?_} of strangers ; ____ of eating undercooked food even after the epidemic was over .", "options": ["distrustful", "disillusioned", "jaundiced", "mistrustful", "chary", "cynical"], "answer": "chary"}, {"question": "____ of strangers ; {_?_} of eating undercooked food even after the epidemic was over .", "options": ["distrustful", "disillusioned", "jaundiced", "mistrustful", "chary", "cynical"], "answer": "chary"}, {"question": "Had she been more {_?_} of his extravagant promises , she would n't be so ____ now", "options": ["distrustful", "disillusioned", "jaundiced", "mistrustful", "chary", "cynical"], "answer": "distrustful"}, {"question": "Had she been more ____ of his extravagant promises , she would n't be so {_?_} now", "options": ["distrustful", "disillusioned", "jaundiced", "mistrustful", "chary", "cynical"], "answer": "disillusioned"}, {"question": "He travels with people who try to appear {_?_} and blase .", "options": ["distrustful", "disillusioned", "jaundiced", "mistrustful", "chary", "cynical"], "answer": "disillusioned"}, {"question": "She was {_?_} about my vow to quit drinking .", "options": ["distrustful", "disillusioned", "jaundiced", "mistrustful", "chary", "cynical"], "answer": "cynical"}, {"question": "{_?_} about any account of the altruism and idealism of young people .", "options": ["distrustful", "disillusioned", "jaundiced", "mistrustful", "chary", "cynical"], "answer": "cynical"}, {"question": "He had a {_?_} attitude toward all proposals for slum clearance that differed in the slightest from his own ; a person who was content to look at life with a ____ eye .", "options": ["distrustful", "disillusioned", "jaundiced", "mistrustful", "chary", "cynical"], "answer": "jaundiced"}, {"question": "He had a ____ attitude toward all proposals for slum clearance that differed in the slightest from his own ; a person who was content to look at life with a {_?_} eye .", "options": ["distrustful", "disillusioned", "jaundiced", "mistrustful", "chary", "cynical"], "answer": "jaundiced"}]}, {"wordSetString": "distrustful,disillusioned,jaundiced,mistrustful,chary,cynical", "original_discussion": "These verbs mean give unlike characteristics or appearances to the members of a group of things .

Doctor is the most general term , and it may also apply to specialists in related branches of medicine , such as psychiatrists , dentists , and veterinarians . A physician is a doctor who is engaged in general practice or in one of its many specialties , while a surgeon is primarily concerned with diseased conditions or injuries that require operative procedures . However , since in recent years medical knowledge has become such a vast field , more and more doctors are taking postgraduate training and are restricting their practice to pediatrics , gynecology , obstetrics , urology , and other specialties . As a result , many of these specialists are not only physicians but are often qualified surgeons . Doctor is the correct title for all of them and is a reference to their having earned the appropriate doc-tor's degree , as M . D . ( doctor of medicine ) , D . D . S . ( doctor of dental surgery ) , D . V . M . ( doctor of veterinary medicine ) . Psychiatrists have earned an M . D . before taking their psychiatric training , whereas psychologists have not . Psychologists , however , like those pursuing any discipline in the arts and sciences , may earn a Ph . D . ( doctor of philosophy ) , but this does not permit them to practice medicine . An < osteopath >  is a practitioner of a school of healing known as osteopathy , which stresses the importance of the musculoskeletal system and its proper functioning as a basis for health . An osteopath is a doctor by virtue of having earned a D . O . ( doctor of osteopathy ) and is now widely permitted by law to practice medicine , prescribe drugs , and undertake surgery when qualified . Often , the preferred method of osteopathic treatment is manipulation of the muscles and bones , especially the backbone . A <chiropractor>  puts a similar emphasis on the spinal area as basic to health and treats patients by manual adjustment and manipulation of this and related areas . Unlike the osteopath , however , the chiropractor does not practice internal medicine or surgery and is not trained to do so . Thus , although a chiropractor may have earned a D . C . ( doctor of chiropractic ) degree , his right to be addressed as doctor is disputed by some . In its narrowest sense , < medic >  refers to an enlisted man in the armed forces who is trained to assist doctors with medical duties in service hospitals or to work with the sick or wounded in combat areas .

More often , doubt indicates a lack of full assent to a proposition that evidence alone can neither confirm nor deny . In this sense , a lack of faith or trust may be indicated . The phrase in doubt refers to something still unsettled or in question . Used alone , doubt can also reflect this lack of decisiveness . < Dubiety >  can function as a considerably more formal substitute for doubt . Dubiety may impart the notion of actively calling something into question rather than simply being passively unsure . On the other hand , dubiety can suggest a wavering between conclusions . This last possibility for dubiety makes it a more formal substitute for < uncertainty >,  which stresses wavering indecision for whatever reason , particularly as it relates to choice or outcome . < Suspicion >  more often concentrates on a single possibility , rather than on alternatives , and indicates a questioning uncertainty that something is what it purports to be . < Skepticism >  is considerably more decisive in tone than the other nouns here , pointing to an unwavering posture of doubt until faced with undeniable proof .

Exact implies a precise reproduction of all details in a standard or model . True indicates absolute accuracy in reproduction , conformity to fact , and consequent validity . It stresses content rather than form . < Identical >  is applied to copies that are just Eke one another or that seem to be exactly alike . It is the strongest of these adjectives and implies correspondence in every detail . Where a duplicate copy is clearly secondary , though it may be exact , identical implies equality , indicating mutual likeness . In plane geometry , < congruent >  refers to figures that are identical in shape and size , filling exactly the same space . Triangles are congruent if every point of one can be brought into correspondence with every point of the other in space , so that the flat figures would coincide exactly if they were superimposed .", "questionList": [{"question": "{_?_} receipts , the original retained by the bank , the carbon returned to the depositor .", "options": ["true", "exact", "congruent", "identical", "duplicate"], "answer": "duplicate"}, {"question": "a dozen {_?_} prints of a photograph .", "options": ["true", "exact", "congruent", "identical", "duplicate"], "answer": "duplicate"}, {"question": "{_?_} copies of a letter ; ____ copies of a book .", "options": ["true", "exact", "congruent", "identical", "duplicate"], "answer": "duplicate"}, {"question": "____ copies of a letter ; {_?_} copies of a book .", "options": ["true", "exact", "congruent", "identical", "duplicate"], "answer": "duplicate"}, {"question": "a {_?_} key .", "options": ["true", "exact", "congruent", "identical", "duplicate"], "answer": "duplicate"}, {"question": "a {_?_} copy of a tax report , kept for the tax-payer's personal records .", "options": ["true", "exact", "congruent", "identical", "duplicate"], "answer": "duplicate"}, {"question": "Writing painstakingly in longhand , the student made an {_?_} copy of the printed poem", "options": ["true", "exact", "congruent", "identical", "duplicate"], "answer": "exact"}, {"question": "By means of the photocopying process , one can easily make an {_?_} reproduction of the printed page .", "options": ["true", "exact", "congruent", "identical", "duplicate"], "answer": "exact"}, {"question": "The college registrar certified the transcript as a {_?_} copy of the student's record", "options": ["true", "exact", "congruent", "identical", "duplicate"], "answer": "true"}, {"question": "The Director of Vital Statistics certified that the birth registration card was a {_?_} copy of facts recorded on the birth record .", "options": ["true", "exact", "congruent", "identical", "duplicate"], "answer": "true"}, {"question": "As far as the eye could tell , the reproduction was {_?_} with the designer's original .", "options": ["true", "exact", "congruent", "identical", "duplicate"], "answer": "identical"}, {"question": "two women wearing {_?_} dresses ; ____ prints made from a woodblock ; Our suits are ____ .", "options": ["true", "exact", "congruent", "identical", "duplicate"], "answer": "identical"}, {"question": "two women wearing ____ dresses ; {_?_} prints made from a woodblock ; Our suits are ____ .", "options": ["true", "exact", "congruent", "identical", "duplicate"], "answer": "identical"}, {"question": "two women wearing ____ dresses ; ____ prints made from a woodblock ; Our suits are {_?_} .", "options": ["true", "exact", "congruent", "identical", "duplicate"], "answer": "identical"}]}, {"wordSetString": "enthusiastic,avid,desirous,eager,intent,keen", "original_discussion": "These adjectives describe a state of extreme readiness and interest in some prospective action or subject , suggesting a willingness to become involved in it . < Eager >  may suggest a general thirst for experience of all kinds or an intense interest of a more specific nature . While eager most often suggests a period before involvement is possible , it may also describe the intensity of involvement itself . < Intent >  relates to this last possibility of eager , suggesting an undivided concentration on the activity itself . It may also suggest a purposeful and determined search for something . < Avid >  and < desirous >  pertain mostly to the period before involvement . While both may refer to an intense longing or craving , desirous might now seem old-fashioned or archaic to many . Avid still retains its forcefulness as an intensification of eager , suggesting a craving on the point of desperation . Like eager , it may also describe actual involvement , but again with greater intensity . < Keen >  and < enthusiastic >  both may suggest an extreme liking for or approval of something . Keen best describes eager involvement . Much more informally , keen indicates a special liking or appetite for something . Enthusiastic is unique among these adjectives in applying mostly to participation rather than expectation , or to a favorable verdict on something already experienced or proposed . For example , a person can be eager for a vacation and enthusiastic about the plans he has made , but he can-not be enthusiastic about the vacation itself until it is underway or past .

Or dine can refer to any formal or special meal . Sup now sounds archaic and pretentious , though once it could refer to an evening or late evening meal . Unlike the preceding pair , < consume >  can refer to people or animals , but its point in either case is the thoroughness of the eating , suggesting the utter and avid taking in of a food . Thus , consume can apply to any process that involves total destruction and in which one thing can be seen as feeding off another . < Gorge >  compares to consume but stresses eating or even overeating to the point of satiety or possibly discomfort , suggesting the gluttonous and indiscriminate stuffing down of food . < Gobble >  emphasizes rapid eating rather than the thoroughness indicated by consume or the excessive-ness possible for gorge . < Wolf >  also emphasizes quickness , but it indicates as well a ravenous ferocity or desperation .

Egotism is disapproving in tone , suggesting someone with an inflated or unrealistic view of his or her own worth because of extreme self-preoccupation . Egoism , on the other hand , is a more ambiguous term . It might apply to persons who do not necessarily consider themselves superior but who nevertheless remain preoccupied exclusively with themselves . Egoism has been given a new slant of meaning , furthermore , by psychological theorists of the last half-century . Theories that stress the importance of a strong ego ( or so-called positive self-concept ) as a key to mental stability have made it possible for egoism to suggest healthy self-interest coupled with a solid sense of identity . < Conceit >  and < vanity >  stress the sense of inflated worth that is involved in egotism . Conceit suggests a general state of being puffed up about one's own imagined superiority to others , so extreme as to rule out self-assessment or self-criticism . Vanity suggests self-pride that is based not so much on a feeling of superiority to others as on an unrealistic admiration and love for self . Conceit no longer sounds as informal as it once may have , but vanity is still the slightly more formal of the two nouns . < Self-importance >  is closely related to conceit and vanity but is more neutral and descriptive . Sometimes , self-importance can suggest considerations of status or involvement in serious or worthwhile affairs rather than a strictly personal conceit . < Narcissism >  and < solipsism >  may once have been technical terms drawn respectively from psychology and philosophy , but they have now gained a wider currency , even in normal conversation , for the cluster of meanings discussed here . Narcissism in a psychological sense refers to extreme withdrawal into self-preoc-cupation and self-love . It has come to be used more loosely to substitute for egotism . Solipsism in a philosophical context refers to a disbelief in the existence of anything beyond the self ; it now extends pejoratively to anyone completely wrapped up in a private world . < Selfishness >  need not suggest an inflated sense of worth at all or even extreme self-preoccupation . Its main connotation is that of grasping greediness without concern for others .

It may suggest rarity as well as refinement , but may or may not suggest a piling up of great or costly masses of detail . < Elaborate >  and < ornate >  both specifically indicate great detailing , but neither necessarily carries the approving tone of elegant . Elaborate indicates a full-scale working out of something with painstaking care and thought . Elaborate can also apply to argument or reasoning that is methodical , lengthy , and abstruse . Ornate is more restricted to decoration , suggesting a denseness that is not so much orderly as sensual . Ornate stresses the finished effect more than the care or work that went into it . Sometimes , richness or costliness of the result is implied . < Luxurious >  and < sumptuous >  specifically stress the sparing of no expense to create something fashionably lavish . These adjectives may or may not point to the tastefulness suggested by elegant or the amassing of detail emphasized by the previous pair , but they do indicate a showiness of general effect . Luxurious often suggests , as well , a setting arranged for comfort and convenience . Luxurious need not be approving ; a luxurious airport that was in the most garish and banal taste possible . Often , however , luxurious is applied approvingly to things in nature , eliminating any notion of costliness but emphasizing denseness , beauty , or richness , as of visual effect . Sumptuous is more likely to be restricted to things made by people ; its root refers to expenditure , and this emphasis on costliness is frequently present . Used more loosely , sumptuous may indicate something well turned out , tasteful , or lavish , without necessarily implying expenditure . < Deluxe >  comes from the French phrase that means of luxury . Thus , it might function identically to luxurious . Deluxe , however , very often refers to special accommodations . In these and other cases , it can refer to added benefits , comforts , or values costing more than the ordinary versions . Since the adjective has become chiefly a merchandising term , it is often used to be deliberately deceptive . < Grandiose >  is the one adjective here that specifically and exclusively stresses a pretentious , inflated , or pompous striving for the elegant or sumptuous .

They may , in fact , suggest savagery and violence . Invade most readily brings to mind a military attack by one nation on another . In other uses this context of military conquest is usually present as a negative connotation . Violate has both a sexual and a legal context . In more general uses , it can express outrage at unethical tactics . < Infringe >  and < trespass >  are mainly restricted to a legal context and are consequently less intensely negative in tone than invade or violate . Infringe most appropriately refers to the violation of a principle or a legal right , while trespass most appropriately refers to the illegal use of or encroachment on the property of someone else . Infringe , thus , compares with intrude , but does not have the personal tone of intrude . Trespass , similarly , compares with invade , but need not imply a concerted attack .

To amuse people is to affect them in such a way that they are put or kept in a pleasant mood . In a nonspecific sense , amuse can suggest any form of distraction that contents the mind . Specifically , amusement emphasizes light entertainment , pointing to something that brings a smile or laugh or that is thought of as fun . A person may be amused by a clever thought , a bizarre sight , a game , a story , an evening's entertainment . But a performance of a Greek tragedy , which can entertain an audience by holding their attention and affording them aesthetic satisfaction , would not be said to amuse . < Divert >  is close to amuse but stresses that the amusement is not constant but is a temporary form of escapism .

As such , it is often used to designate the highest class in a grading , rating , or ranking system . Often , however , as with most superlatives , excellent is not thought to be high enough in its praise and it takes second place to some other word . Neither < first-class >  nor < first-rate >  admits of this sort of devaluation ; one thing cannot be more first-rate than another . Both indicate the highest category in a ranking system . First-class can suggest a military or paramilitary' system . Even outside this context the adjective would suggest a set of clear categories into which things can be placed by objective evaluation . first-class permit . As can be seen , any notion of excellence may well be absent from this adjective's meaning . Used more loosely and subjectively , first-class can describe anything one likes or approves of . First-rate may sometimes suggest careful evaluation based more on imponderables than on objective categorization . But while inherent worth is usually indicated by the first-rate , it can sometimes point to something consequential rather than excellent . First-rate is even more open than first-class to uses indicating mere subjective approval . Both adjectives can also indicate something that is thought to be supremely bad ; first-class may lend itself more readily to this use , but in any case , it can give a more informal tone and may have comic force . Most specifically , < prime >  indicates , under the grading system of the U . S . Department of Agriculture , the highest grade of beef or lamb ; < choice >  indicates a grade between prime and good . In other contexts , prime can refer to something of first significance , urgency , or value . Prime can also refer to anything that is excellent , best , most typical , or at its peak . More neutrally , it can suggest the main part of something or what comes first . Choice , by contrast , refers to something that fulfills high and discriminating standards . Oddly enough , choice often seems the stronger of the two adjectives in other contexts than the grading of meat . By implication , what is prime may be overlooked or easily available , whereas choice suggests the successful discrimination of what is both rare and excellent . < Select >  can refer to lumber that is relatively free of blemish or knots . More generally , select compares with choice by stressing discrimination , but differs in often referring to a sampling of excellent things that cannot be presented in full . A weakening of the force of select may result by analogy with selected , which may indicate arbitrary compression or subjective sampling .", "questionList": [{"question": "an eating guide that rated many restaurants as good or very good , but only a few as {_?_} .", "options": ["choice", "excellent", "select", "prime", "first-class", "first-rate"], "answer": "excellent"}, {"question": "a debating team disappointed at getting an {_?_} instead of a Superior rating .", "options": ["choice", "excellent", "select", "prime", "first-class", "first-rate"], "answer": "excellent"}, {"question": "a {_?_} scout ;

Chubby sometimes has an aura of well-intended humor . < Adipose >  is most strictly a biological term for fatty tissue itself ; when used as a substitute for fat , adipose has comic effect , sometimes less well-intentioned than chubby .", "questionList": [{"question": "a man who was unbelievably {_?_} .", "options": ["stout", "fat", "obese", "buxom", "plump", "portly", "chubby", "adipose", "corpulent"], "answer": "fat"}, {"question": "a boy who already looked slightly {_?_} .", "options": ["stout", "fat", "obese", "buxom", "plump", "portly", "chubby", "adipose", "corpulent"], "answer": "fat"}, {"question": "the incidence of heart failure in {_?_} persons .", "options": ["stout", "fat", "obese", "buxom", "plump", "portly", "chubby", "adipose", "corpulent"], "answer": "obese"}, {"question": "a smiling , {_?_} Buddha .", "options": ["stout", "fat", "obese", "buxom", "plump", "portly", "chubby", "adipose", "corpulent"], "answer": "corpulent"}, {"question": "the {_?_} matrons who served tea after the recital ; the ____ innkeeper with the cherubic face .", "options": ["stout", "fat", "obese", "buxom", "plump", "portly", "chubby", "adipose", "corpulent"], "answer": "portly"}, {"question": "the ____ matrons who served tea after the recital ; the {_?_} innkeeper with the cherubic face .", "options": ["stout", "fat", "obese", "buxom", "plump", "portly", "chubby", "adipose", "corpulent"], "answer": "stout"}, {"question": "Rubens's {_?_} female figures that would today be considered / at ; a ____ baby .", "options": ["stout", "fat", "obese", "buxom", "plump", "portly", "chubby", "adipose", "corpulent"], "answer": "plump"}, {"question": "Rubens's ____ female figures that would today be considered / at ; a {_?_} baby .", "options": ["stout", "fat", "obese", "buxom", "plump", "portly", "chubby", "adipose", "corpulent"], "answer": "plump"}, {"question": "the {_?_} , potbellied scoutmas-ter and his scrawny charges .", "options": ["stout", "fat", "obese", "buxom", "plump", "portly", "chubby", "adipose", "corpulent"], "answer": "plump"}, {"question": "{_?_} pioneer women .", "options": ["stout", "fat", "obese", "buxom", "plump", "portly", "chubby", "adipose", "corpulent"], "answer": "buxom"}, {"question": "especially {_?_} homecoming queens .", "options": ["stout", "fat", "obese", "buxom", "plump", "portly", "chubby", "adipose", "corpulent"], "answer": "buxom"}, {"question": "the {_?_} little girl ; the ____ man's twinkling eyes .", "options": ["stout", "fat", "obese", "buxom", "plump", "portly", "chubby", "adipose", "corpulent"], "answer": "chubby"}, {"question": "the ____ little girl ; the {_?_} man's twinkling eyes .", "options": ["stout", "fat", "obese", "buxom", "plump", "portly", "chubby", "adipose", "corpulent"], "answer": "chubby"}, {"question": "{_?_} ladies and gentlemen who rush to health spas .", "options": ["stout", "fat", "obese", "buxom", "plump", "portly", "chubby", "adipose", "corpulent"], "answer": "adipose"}]}, {"wordSetString": "deadly,fatal,mortal,lethal", "original_discussion": "The adjective < fatal >  is used to describe anything capable of causing or actually has caused death ; it carries a strong suggestion of the inevitability of fate . < Deadly >  is interchangeable with fatal in this sense .

More often , it is true , faultfinding suggests an eagerness to seek out weakness for its own sake , but even here the adjective is less severe in tone than the following adjectives . < Hypercritical >  suggests a harsher attitude than that suggested by faultfinding , pointing to someone overly eager to disparage , possibly out of a reluctance to recognize or honor good qualities in others . In further contrast to faultfinding , a hypercritical person need not necessarily dwell on weaknesses in something at all ; he or she may simply reject it wholesale as obviously inferior . < Censorious >  is similar to hypercritical in allowing the possibility of a blanket rejection . It is even harsher in tone , however , suggesting an attitude that is exclusively negative in its judgments . Someone who is hypercritical might be expected to spell out views in some detail and to have , at least , some standards for measurement ; someone censorious , however , might merely express a negative evaluation without explanation or without having such standards . The adjective , furthermore , has overtones of prissy or priggish ill will . < Captious >  suggests a further extreme than the foregoing adjectives , but not so much toward a greater severity of judgment as toward a truly irresponsible or whimsical refusal to be pleased by the most meticulous effort . Captious may suggest faultfinding that deliberately wishes to confuse rather than enlighten , especially when this results in fruitless argument . < Carping >  and < caviling >  are better used to describe single acts of faultfinding rather than a hypercritical or censorious attitude . Both may suggest a zealous glee in scornfully condemning something on the basis of picayune considerations or niggling faults ; some difference between them can be seen , however , by noting that caviling derives from words meaning jest , mock , or raillery , and carping from words meaning dispute or boast . Carping best suggests a pedantic railing at or making a mockery of something for small failures ; cav-iling more often suggests strident or grating verbal attacks in which reasonable or generally acceptable propositions are imputed because of trivial lapses . < Nitpicking >  is a colorful adjective and noun that stresses an excessive concern with small or trivial faults or with making distinctions so fine as to be pointless ; this concern may be either well-intentioned , though misguided , or deliberately hostile . < Pedantic >  is an adjective that is less directly related to the notion of disapproval . It emphasizes , instead , someone intent on needless displays of learning or petty points of scholarship .

More simply , favorable may refer to approval . Most pertinent here , it pertains to signs that suggest an advantageous result . < Auspicious >  and < propitious >  are restricted to this last possibility of favorable .

Lucky refers instead to a chance occurrence that proves beneficial . In a less precise use , it can also refer to any positive circumstance , with less emphasis on chance . < Good >  is the least formal and in its generality the least precise of these adjectives in referring to a positive circumstance . It can also refer to signs that augur a beneficial outcome . < Fortunate >  may once have implied a favorable augury ; more often now , it indicates present success or good circumstances . This implication even overshadows a use that relates to lucky in stressing more formally benefits that result from chance . One use of < happy >  relates it to fortunate and lucky , suggesting advantages that result not from chance but from a discriminating choice of means that later events corroborate .

Rank stresses disgusting offensiveness and tends to indicate moral corruption rather than simple error .

While flaw suggests something that detracts from completeness , effectiveness , or perfection , < fault >  points to something that impairs excellence . A flaw can refer to something missing . Fault usually refers to something present and to something inherent in the nature of a thing rather than external to it ; flaw can refer to the superficial as well as to the profound . In connection with character , flaw is somewhat more elegant and dramatic than the more prosaic fault . While flaw may or may not indicate something easily removed or overcome , < defect >  often suggests a flaw so serious as to completely prevent functioning . Since defect is now often used of machines , its application to human personality sometimes indicates a judgmental or simplistic view of human nature , suggesting easily traceable explanations for malfunction . In other contexts defect may refer to an error or the lack of something needed for completion . < Blemish >  refers especially to marks or qualities that disfigure or make imperfect . Blemish applies particularly to defects of the skin . It may also be used figuratively . < Imperfection >  is closer to flaw than to defect in that it stresses malfunction less than incompleteness or lack of order . Whereas a flaw may be self-evident , imperfection points more often to a lack that may be a matter of opinion . Like defect , imperfection also implies a criterion or an established canon by which to judge something . And as defect relates to function , imperfection relates to form , drawing defect toward a scientific context , imperfection toward an artistic context . With imperfection , however , the judgment remains relative since no completely perfect thing exists . < Failing >, < shortcoming >,  and < foible >  are the mildest of these nouns , suggesting a specific lapse in an otherwise sound entity . All three most commonly relate to personality , describing a characteristic way of behaving that is not desirable but does not vitiate goodness or overall effectiveness . Foible is perhaps the mildest of the three nouns , suggesting a slight but ingrained eccentricity that may easily be recognized by others and allowed for without causing great difficulties . A foible , in fact , may be almost harmless and even endearing . Failing may suggest a more severe shortcoming that has more serious consequences . Sometimes , the special point of failing is to indicate well-intentioned effort that does not succeed . Shortcoming , like failing , may refer to failures or deficiencies in things as well as people , and in this sense compares with one sense of flaw .

The recoiling action , furthermore , may be slighter , briefer , or less noticeable than the action indicated by flinch . Wince can function less literally for any pained response .

Where forswear can suggest moral resolve or penitence , < abjure >  is more forceful in sometimes implying an angry rejection ; it also referred once to renunciation under oath , but less often applies in this way now . < Disavow >  and < disclaim >  are now most commonly used to deny complicity or responsibility ; thus , both contrast with forswear , which often implies an admission of guilt . Disavow once could involve a formal oath ; now it more often points to a refusal to acknowledge something as valid or an insistence that no connection exists between one's own stand and that of another . Disclaim can also function as a denial of responsibility , but its special point is the giving up of a right that might be offered in one's own behalf . < Disown >  at its most general can suggest any sort of abandonment .

Usually , this noun suggests an acting out of the mental state in rapid but possibly disordered movements . It also suggests a spurt or seizure of emotion that goads one into action , rather than a steady or constant state . When frenzy refers to emotional imbalance rather than hyperbolically indicating frantic effort , the emotions suggested include hate , anger , terror , or other negative responses to externals . < Mania >  in one of its particulars contrasts strongly with this suggestion of negative response in frenzy , since it can refer to an extreme liking or craving for something . Furthermore , a mania may be present over a long period of time without necessarily being acted out . In a psychiatric context , mania is used more strictly to refer to a mental disorder in which one is pervaded with a sense of well-being but acts in excessive and deranged ways . Where frenzy may suggest angry outbursts and mania a continual craving , < hysteria >  suggests emotional seizures of grief or fear as expressed by uncontrolled sobbing . Uncontrolled laughter is also a possible result of hysteria , although such laughter would hardly stem from even an illusory happiness . Psychiatrically , hysteria refers to an abnormal condition that results from nervous malfunction or sexual repression and is characterized by violent emotional paroxysms and disturbances in sensory and motor functions . < Delirium >  indicates a deranged state that may be the by-product of fever , epilepsy , or alcoholism , or the primary effect of narcotic or psychedelic drugs . This noun may suggest agitation like that of frenzy , but it does not necessarily suggest any physical activity whatsoever ; it does indicate a rambling or hallucinating mind .

One's < friend >  in Shakespearean England meant one's mistress . Now it has lost this sexual meaning completely and means a person one is fond of and chooses to associate with . A business associate , one's spouse , or a member of one's family all may or may not be one's friend , while a friend may or may not be a person one would wish to work with or live with . An < acquaintance >  is a person one has met and sees occasionally with cordiality but without intimacy . < Companion >  is ambiguous . It may suggest the closeness of friend . Or it may suggest the casual association of acquaintance . In the case of acquaintance or companion , the noun stresses the physical presence of the person referred to ; in the case of companion , however , the relationship might be controlled strictly by chance or necessity , without even the implied cordiality of acquaintance . Companion has recently come into use as a euphemism for lover and may suggest a heterosexual or homosexual lover . The rest of these nouns relate to the closeness of friend , each with a unique overtone that implies its own particular kind of closeness . < Intimate >  suggests inseparable and affectionate friendship ; it is less frequently used in this sense now , however , because the sexual reference of intimate in another context obtrudes here , where no note of sexuality was originally intended . < Comrade >  has also suffered because of the obtrusion of another meaning of the noun . Originally used for a man's male friend , with jolliness and heartiness as overtones , it lost out to its specific use as a form of address among members of the Communist Party . < Crony >  is now a more widely used informal noun for a close friend than either intimate or comrade , but it has a strong colloquial tang and implies the gossipy closeness of a clique . Its common form , old crony , suggests a relationship of long standing based on reminiscence . Many slang words exist to describe close friends ; the most common at present may be < buddy >,  partially replacing such choices as mate , chum , and pal . The frequency with which words for a male friend rise into and fall from favor may suggest an embarrassment over the affectionate side of friendship and a continuing search for a referent whose neutral and casual tone will be considered uncompromising in its manliness . < Confidant >  compares with crony in suggesting an exchange of gossip as the staple of a friendship . Where crony more commonly refers to a man's male friend , however , confidant refers more often to a woman's female companion and may thus be spelled confidante .

It often indicates a fear of physical harm , but it may also apply to fears rooted in emotion or arising from imagination . In an immediate sense , a person is frightened by a cause of fear addressed directly and suddenly to the senses and may react physically in a number of negative ways -- shivering , shuddering , freezing , fainting , screaming , running , hiding , even having a heart attack . At one extreme , being frightened may involve only a brief pang or flutter of fear . At the other extreme , it may imply dread or terror that paralyzes thought , motion , or response , leaving one in a state of shock . Frighten is also used to indicate a fearful , apprehensive state of mind . < Scare >  is close to frighten in that it can imply either sudden , unnerving fear or a fearful , uneasy state . Even more strongly than frighten , it stresses a reflex physical reaction , whether literal or figurative . But scare is a more informal than frighten and may suggest a milder or more superficial form of fear . Unlike frighten , it is a child's word , and it emphasizes the immediacy of fear , whatever the cause . Scare is also often used to suggest the deliberate stimulation of fear , as in games , teasing , initiation , practical jokes , or other forms of amusement , whether harmless or dangerous . [ I scared you , didn't I ? The stunt pilot scared his passenger half to death with his daredevil feats . ] < Startle >  stresses the element of suddenness , usually involving an involuntary reaction to an unexpected stimulus . A startled person may gasp , jump , draw back , or make a quick , jerky movement and then freeze . In another sense , startle may indicate an inner , intellectual surprise at something unexpected . < Terrify >  is the strongest of these verbs , suggesting extreme , overwhelming fear that is close to panic .

Genius may be applied particularly to a single area . An < aptitude >  is a natural or acquired ability to learn and become proficient , while a < faculty >  is a particular mental skill or power . While aptitude suggests quickness in learning , often in gaining mastery of an academic discipline or artistic skill , faculty is at once more modest and more general in application , suggesting only an inhering attribute or skill . < Talent >  is a particular and uncommon aptitude for some special work or activity ; it is conceived of as an inborn resource that may or may not be developed . Whereas genius applies to general intellectual or artistic superiority , talent is a specific natural endowment or < gift >,  a talent for designing clothes for young women ; a remarkable talent for staging and directing plays . Genius may also be used in the sense of special aptitude . Gift is akin to genius but on a lower plane . Gift emphasizes the inborn quality of a skill . Unlike talent , gift does not necessarily imply creative ability or originality . Gift may apply to any striking or remarkable personal ability or power . Whereas faculty is most often used positively when applied to an interpersonal quality , talent , and especially genius , being progressively more exaggerated and figurative in such contexts , are often used negatively and emphatically , sometimes with comical effect . An < instinct >,  as here considered , is a natural aptitude , in which sense it is really an extension of its basic psychobiological meaning referring to an animal's innate tendency or response to act in ways essential to its development or preservation . Instinct usually implies innate disposition rather than talent . Instinct can , however , be used of qualities that are not inborn but have been so thoroughly acquired that they seem as if they were . In this sense instinct is close to < knack >,  which refers to an ability to do something readily and well ; knack applies more often to social than to intellectual situations . < Bent >  refers to personal inclination or penchant ; it does not necessarily imply an accompanying aptitude , but since it is human nature to like doing what one does well , aptitude and bent are often present in the same person . Bent often suggests devotion and industry .", "questionList": [{"question": "the {_?_} of Leonardo da Vinci , whose notebooks , written in the late 15th and early 16th centuries , include designs of flying machines , improvements in weaponry , and complicated labor-saving mechanical systems utilizing gears and pulleys , as well as detailed scientific observations in biology , geology , and other subjects .", "options": ["aptitude", "genius", "bent", "instinct", "talent", "knack", "faculty", "gift"], "answer": "genius"}, {"question": "the artistic {_?_} of a Picasso , whose unique achievement merits his dominant place in the history of art .", "options": ["aptitude", "genius", "bent", "instinct", "talent", "knack", "faculty", "gift"], "answer": "genius"}, {"question": "He lacks completely the {_?_} of self-criticism", "options": ["aptitude", "genius", "bent", "instinct", "talent", "knack", "faculty", "gift"], "answer": "faculty"}, {"question": "an early {_?_} for mathematics", "options": ["aptitude", "genius", "bent", "instinct", "talent", "knack", "faculty", "gift"], "answer": "aptitude"}, {"question": "The child demonstrated her {_?_} for music by the ease with which she picked out melodies by ear .", "options": ["aptitude", "genius", "bent", "instinct", "talent", "knack", "faculty", "gift"], "answer": "aptitude"}, {"question": "to have a {_?_} for turning a small investment into a successful business .", "options": ["aptitude", "genius", "bent", "instinct", "talent", "knack", "faculty", "gift"], "answer": "genius"}, {"question": "the {_?_} of a poet's sensibility and verbal acumen .", "options": ["aptitude", "genius", "bent", "instinct", "talent", "knack", "faculty", "gift"], "answer": "gift"}, {"question": "a {_?_} of intensely appreciating music ;

Here , it may refer to groups that possess wealth , influence , or position . Or it may refer to an accomplished person or the person's accomplishments . Great is more far-reaching in the latter sense , since it implies that an accomplishment has been critically evaluated or tested by time in light of its contribution to art , knowledge , or humanity . The social sense of great , by contrast , merely implies the winning of status in a constricted or transitory sphere . < Reputable >,  while much more formal , functions like great in both ways . In either case , however , it may point to mere acceptance or absence of fault rather than to the genuine brilliance of a person or the per-son's work in its own right . Reputable implies approval by those in a position to know rather than far-reaching fame . This makes it the mildest of the adjectives here . < Illustrious >,  the strongest term here , shows the sharpest possible contrast with reputable , since it always suggests fame or glory . Illustrious , furthermore , is mostly restricted to the accomplished or to their accomplishments and may not necessarily indicate a reputable person at all . When used in the context of social standing , illustrious usually applies to people who have added brilliant accomplishments to wealth , status , or rank . < Notable >  and < noteworthy >  are somewhat stronger in tone than reputable , but both apply more exclusively to accomplished people or to their accomplishments . Both adjectives would seem to point to something that merits attention , but in practice notable indicates those people or things that are actually known , respected , or admired , whereas noteworthy indicates what is worthy of attention but may not yet have received it . In short , notable often suggests successful achievement , noteworthy a promising effort . < Eminent >  is considerably stronger in emphasis than all the preceding terms but illustrious . Here , however , eminent functions equally well in the contexts both of social status and of accomplishment . Eminent has a dignified tone , suggesting solid , well-respected values , and points to the most admired members of a given class . This makes eminent less pertinent to the arts than to the academic disciplines , the sciences , or the learned professions . < Preeminent >  is a superlative for eminent , indicating a person who is the most respected of an already admired group . It also tends to suggest a position of great power and authority . Neither of this pair is likely to be used in describing an accomplishment . Moreover , in emphasizing respectability eminent and preeminent do not approach illustrious in suggesting widespread renown . A person may be eminent , even preeminent in a field and still not be in any way illustrious .", "questionList": [{"question": "the {_?_} families of Boston .", "options": ["noteworthy", "eminent", "reputable", "preeminent", "great", "illustrious", "notable"], "answer": "great"}, {"question": "a {_?_} composer ; Newton's ____ discovery .", "options": ["noteworthy", "eminent", "reputable", "preeminent", "great", "illustrious", "notable"], "answer": "great"}, {"question": "a ____ composer ; Newton's {_?_} discovery .", "options": ["noteworthy", "eminent", "reputable", "preeminent", "great", "illustrious", "notable"], "answer": "great"}, {"question": "a {_?_} family of successful merchants ; a ____ scholar , a bit on the dry side ; a ____ but outdated work on the subject .", "options": ["noteworthy", "eminent", "reputable", "preeminent", "great", "illustrious", "notable"], "answer": "reputable"}, {"question": "a ____ family of successful merchants ; a {_?_} scholar , a bit on the dry side ; a ____ but outdated work on the subject .", "options": ["noteworthy", "eminent", "reputable", "preeminent", "great", "illustrious", "notable"], "answer": "reputable"}, {"question": "a ____ family of successful merchants ; a ____ scholar , a bit on the dry side ; a {_?_} but outdated work on the subject .", "options": ["noteworthy", "eminent", "reputable", "preeminent", "great", "illustrious", "notable"], "answer": "reputable"}, {"question": "{_?_} deeds ; an ____ poet who scandalized the ____ upper classes of his day .", "options": ["noteworthy", "eminent", "reputable", "preeminent", "great", "illustrious", "notable"], "answer": "illustrious"}, {"question": "____ deeds ; an {_?_} poet who scandalized the ____ upper classes of his day .", "options": ["noteworthy", "eminent", "reputable", "preeminent", "great", "illustrious", "notable"], "answer": "illustrious"}, {"question": "____ deeds ; an ____ poet who scandalized the {_?_} upper classes of his day .", "options": ["noteworthy", "eminent", "reputable", "preeminent", "great", "illustrious", "notable"], "answer": "reputable"}, {"question": "an {_?_} family that gave England some of its finest generals , statesmen , and thinkers over several centuries .", "options": ["noteworthy", "eminent", "reputable", "preeminent", "great", "illustrious", "notable"], "answer": "illustrious"}, {"question": "several {_?_} authors who are scheduled to publish books in the coming season ; the only critic to characterize the book as a ____ attempt despite its failure .", "options": ["noteworthy", "eminent", "reputable", "preeminent", "great", "illustrious", "notable"], "answer": "notable"}, {"question": "several ____ authors who are scheduled to publish books in the coming season ; the only critic to characterize the book as a {_?_} attempt despite its failure .", "options": ["noteworthy", "eminent", "reputable", "preeminent", "great", "illustrious", "notable"], "answer": "noteworthy"}, {"question": "families considered {_?_} enough to be listed in the Social Register ; an ____ scientist .", "options": ["noteworthy", "eminent", "reputable", "preeminent", "great", "illustrious", "notable"], "answer": "eminent"}, {"question": "families considered ____ enough to be listed in the Social Register ; an {_?_} scientist .", "options": ["noteworthy", "eminent", "reputable", "preeminent", "great", "illustrious", "notable"], "answer": "eminent"}, {"question": "an {_?_} painter ; an ____ critic ; an ____ Supreme Court Justice .", "options": ["noteworthy", "eminent", "reputable", "preeminent", "great", "illustrious", "notable"], "answer": "illustrious"}, {"question": "an ____ painter ; an {_?_} critic ; an ____ Supreme Court Justice .", "options": ["noteworthy", "eminent", "reputable", "preeminent", "great", "illustrious", "notable"], "answer": "eminent"}, {"question": "an ____ painter ; an ____ critic ; an {_?_} Supreme Court Justice .", "options": ["noteworthy", "eminent", "reputable", "preeminent", "great", "illustrious", "notable"], "answer": "eminent"}, {"question": "the {_?_} molder of taste in her era .", "options": ["noteworthy", "eminent", "reputable", "preeminent", "great", "illustrious", "notable"], "answer": "preeminent"}]}, {"wordSetString": "acquisitive,avaricious,rapacious,envious,gluttonous,stingy,miserly,covetous,greedy", "original_discussion": "These adjectives describe various kinds of insatiable desire for food , money , power , or material possessions . < Greedy >,  the most general , is less formal than some of the other terms in this group . Although greedy can refer to a desire for money , power , or property , it more commonly relates to an inordinate desire for food . Greedy less readily suggests the use of unethical means in seeking satisfaction . < Avaricious >  is a more formal term than greedy and suggests an unbalanced , almost fanatic desire for money or possessions . The overtones possible in avaricious relate it to three much more informal adjectives . Stingy emphasizes a lack of generosity , especially the reluctance to spend money . Miserly refers more to the hoarding of money or property than to either the gluttonous consumption or the stingy use of it . Avaricious persons may be either gluttonous or miserly , depending on whether they consume or merely possess wealth . In either case , such persons may or may not be stingy . Of these four adjectives , however , avaricious perhaps carries the strongest suggestion of being willing to use unethical means to satisfy a given desire . < Acquisitive >  is considerably more neutral in tone than any of the other adjectives . It suggests the actual process of coming into the possession of goods whether by fair means or foul . In being more externally descriptive , it puts the emphasis on the act rather than on the desire . A poor person may desire possessions , but not actually be acquisitive until , by some means , there is an opportunity to assemble them . In contrast to the neutrality of acquisitive , < rapacious >  is the most strongly negative of all these adjectives . It blurs together desire and act , with overtones of brutality and violence . It emphasizes the taking of things against the will of others , by force or unethical means . < Envious >  and < covetous >  are opposed to avaricious and especially to acquisitive in suggesting more the intense desire for something than the act of possessing it . The desired item , furthermore , must necessarily belong to someone else . Envious implies the greater passivity of the two , referring to a hostile or inverted admiration for the belongings of another . Sometimes it is the impossibility of possessing them that provides the key . Covetous is the more intense of the two and the less passive , shading off toward avaricious in its potential for being acted upon . Both envious and covetous can apply to a wider range of desired goods or qualities than the other adjectives grouped here .", "questionList": [{"question": "He stuffed one chocolate after another into his {_?_} mouth", "options": ["acquisitive", "avaricious", "rapacious", "envious", "gluttonous", "stingy", "miserly", "covetous", "greedy"], "answer": "greedy"}, {"question": "{_?_} for profits , speculators lay waste virgin forests throughout the West .", "options": ["acquisitive", "avaricious", "rapacious", "envious", "gluttonous", "stingy", "miserly", "covetous", "greedy"], "answer": "greedy"}, {"question": "A {_?_} child left undisciplined may grow up to be a selfish adult .", "options": ["acquisitive", "avaricious", "rapacious", "envious", "gluttonous", "stingy", "miserly", "covetous", "greedy"], "answer": "greedy"}, {"question": "The {_?_} child abandoned his toys as soon as he got them , but still cried for more .", "options": ["acquisitive", "avaricious", "rapacious", "envious", "gluttonous", "stingy", "miserly", "covetous", "greedy"], "answer": "avaricious"}, {"question": "< {_?_} > , < ____ > , and < ____ > , ____ puts the emphasis on consumption , most commonly of food .", "options": ["acquisitive", "avaricious", "rapacious", "envious", "gluttonous", "stingy", "miserly", "covetous", "greedy"], "answer": "gluttonous"}, {"question": "< ____ > , < {_?_} > , and < ____ > , ____ puts the emphasis on consumption , most commonly of food .", "options": ["acquisitive", "avaricious", "rapacious", "envious", "gluttonous", "stingy", "miserly", "covetous", "greedy"], "answer": "stingy"}, {"question": "< ____ > , < ____ > , and < {_?_} > , ____ puts the emphasis on consumption , most commonly of food .", "options": ["acquisitive", "avaricious", "rapacious", "envious", "gluttonous", "stingy", "miserly", "covetous", "greedy"], "answer": "miserly"}, {"question": "< ____ > , < ____ > , and < ____ > , {_?_} puts the emphasis on consumption , most commonly of food .", "options": ["acquisitive", "avaricious", "rapacious", "envious", "gluttonous", "stingy", "miserly", "covetous", "greedy"], "answer": "gluttonous"}, {"question": "His {_?_} appetite made short work of all the leftovers .", "options": ["acquisitive", "avaricious", "rapacious", "envious", "gluttonous", "stingy", "miserly", "covetous", "greedy"], "answer": "gluttonous"}, {"question": "She was so {_?_} that she never tipped a delivery boy .", "options": ["acquisitive", "avaricious", "rapacious", "envious", "gluttonous", "stingy", "miserly", "covetous", "greedy"], "answer": "stingy"}, {"question": "Their {_?_} piling up of wealth had not made up for their inability to bear children .", "options": ["acquisitive", "avaricious", "rapacious", "envious", "gluttonous", "stingy", "miserly", "covetous", "greedy"], "answer": "miserly"}, {"question": "The {_?_} lawyer had cheated his own parents out of the title to their land .", "options": ["acquisitive", "avaricious", "rapacious", "envious", "gluttonous", "stingy", "miserly", "covetous", "greedy"], "answer": "avaricious"}, {"question": "Thoreau argues that our {_?_} tendencies prevent us from living unburdened , joyous lives .", "options": ["acquisitive", "avaricious", "rapacious", "envious", "gluttonous", "stingy", "miserly", "covetous", "greedy"], "answer": "acquisitive"}, {"question": "He was so {_?_} in his lust for money that he impoverished entire families .", "options": ["acquisitive", "avaricious", "rapacious", "envious", "gluttonous", "stingy", "miserly", "covetous", "greedy"], "answer": "rapacious"}, {"question": "He would always be {_?_} of his brother's extraordinary success .", "options": ["acquisitive", "avaricious", "rapacious", "envious", "gluttonous", "stingy", "miserly", "covetous", "greedy"], "answer": "envious"}, {"question": "The ninth and tenth commandments are a sharp condemnation of the {_?_} person .", "options": ["acquisitive", "avaricious", "rapacious", "envious", "gluttonous", "stingy", "miserly", "covetous", "greedy"], "answer": "covetous"}]}, {"wordSetString": "greet,accost,welcome,salute,address,hail", "original_discussion": "These verbs all refer to the words or actions offered or exchanged in the first moments of a meeting . < Greet >  can indicate any sign of recognition or acknowledgment ; on first glance it might be thought to suggest a warm , friendly , or cheerful response .

Taking a stand on an issue the church has not ruled on would not make a person a heretic . And while the church may punish a heretic by ejecting the person or , at one time , putting him or her to death , a heretic's aim need not be to separate from the church but possibly to stay within and reform it . A < schismatic >,  by contrast , may or may not have serious doctrinal objections to church teachings , but such a person's avowed aim is to establish a separatist faction or competing religious body . A schismatic , furthermore , would most likely be one of a group or its leader , whereas a heretic can be a single individual with or without followers . < Dissenter >  and < nonconformist >  both originally pertained to people who in some way opposed the established Church of England . A dissenter was some-one who rejected a particular doctrine without leaving the church , while a nonconformist was anyone who would not give to the established church the loyalty required by law . Roughly speaking , a dissenter criticized from within the Church of England , a nonconformist resisted from without . < Sectarian >  once referred to a schismatic who founded or advocated the founding of a denomination independent of the original church . Later , it could simply indicate a member of any denomination or sect . More recently , sectarian has been avoided altogether because it can imply a superior-inferior relationship between the original church and the later formation . Dissenter and nonconformist are widely used outside the context of religion . In this case , dissenter usually implies someone who is extremely critical of some established order and wishes to reform it . Nonconformist , by contrast , more often refers to someone who is idiosyncratic in personal behavior and appearance in such a way as to exhibit a sharp departure from custom ; nonconformist , thus , need not suggest advocacy of any formulated ideological stand whatsoever .

This contrasts strongly with < pause >,  which can only imply an interruption of activity already under way . Pause is also the most neutral of all these verbs in referring to a temporary halt . While all the other verbs suggest uneasiness , however faintly , pause may suggest a preconceived plan and indicate no irresoluteness whatsoever . The point of pause may be brevity . Or its point may be to stress the mere fact of the halt , without ascribing motive . < Falter >  has a much clearer emotional overtone than hesitate or pause . It suggests either intense doubt , helplessness , awkwardness , or incompetence . Falter , like pause , may suggest an interruption , but it can also suggest an extremely slow or faulty performance , as in the last example above . In this sense , < flounder >  is an intensification of falter , referring to a bungled action that continues erratically because of panic or disablement . < Waver >  and < vacillate >,  by contrast , return to the milder uneasiness of hesitate , although both may suggest a poorly continued action rather than a temporary halt or initial moment of indecision . Both , in fact , suggest an action that goes back and forth between two alternatives . Vacillate would be more appropriate to describe mental activity that veers between extremes . Where hesitate in such a context might suggest a suspension of will , vacillate suggests wild swings of choice . Waver would be more appropriate to describe a physical act that reveals uncertainty .

Because of this , tall is preferred over high in more formal contexts to indicate vertical height . But the informal use of high in this sense remains secure .

Tall has fewer metaphorical uses , one of them being in reference to masculinity . < Elevated >,  considerably more formal than the foregoing , is like high in referring both to vertical dimension and placement at an altitude .

Specifically , home refers to a place where one lives on a more or less permanent basis and with which one has strong personal ties of affection and loyalty . Home may also refer to a region or country in which one was bom , brought up , or now resides . By extension , the natural habitats of animals or the places in which they seek shelter for the raising of their young are often spoken of as homes . < Residence >  is a more formal word for home and has the suggestion of an imposing or pretentious dwelling . Residence may be used to distinguish a person's place of business or professional activity from his or her home . A residential neighborhood is one made up largely of homes or residences rather than of commercial buildings . Residence is sometimes applied to housing provided by an educational or other institution for its students or staff members .

Abode can also refer to a place such as a hotel , camp , or cottage by the sea in which one stays only temporarily . A < hovel >  is a small , wretched home and suggests squalor and poverty . < Habitation >  is a generic term and is chiefly applied to the dwellings of people who have settled , permanent homes , in contradistinction to nomads or gypsies , who habitually shift their abodes to find food , pasturage , or work . Except in a legal sense , < domicile >  is rarely used . Domicile denotes a home or residence over which the owner has certain rights and responsibilities by law and in which he or she intends to reside indefinitely . < Household >  refers to a domestic establishment , that is , to the persons dwelling together under one roof as a social unit , and not to any actual structure . It may include not only the members of a family or other organized group , but servants as well . A household may also consist of a single person living alone .

Relative humidity is the ratio , expressed as a percentage , of the amount of water vapor actually in the air at a specific time to the total amount that could be present at the same temperature . Humid , therefore , alone or with a qualifying adverb can designate any state of atmospheric dampness . The other adjectives in this group are less precise in meaning but more colorful in tone . < Close >  can refer to the weather or to a place . When one thinks of a close day it is in terms of being choked or suffocated by weather that is heavy , hot , and still . A room described as close has probably not been ventilated for some time ; its unmoving air has grown stale and thick so that it induces an uncomfortable feeling of confinement . < Oppressive >  is the most general of these adjectives ; it can apply to any kind of harsh weather that causes depression or discomfort . A close day with a thunder-storm lurking and no breeze stirring is certainly oppressive . But so , too , is a day on which the wind never stops blowing , whether it be hot or cold , rainy or dry . It is true that oppressive is mostly used in reference to hot , sultry weather , but any climatic condition that produces a state of oppression can be characterized as oppressive .

More generally , hunt can indicate an uncertain groping for something needed . It can also indicate an urgent following . And it can point to any act of looking for something lost or missing . < Track >  and < sleuth >  relate closely to the aspect of hunt pertaining to following a quarry . Track can indicate the ability to detect a trail of clues . It can also apply more widely for hunting anything fugitive or difficult to find . Sleuth compares such action to detective work and can apply as widely . But here the verb refers more often to the search for clues itself , particularly where the quarry is not yet known . < Search >  and < seek >  are considerably more general than the previous pair . Search may indicate the act of looking for a lost object or for an object presumed to exist . The verb may also apply to mere activity without clearly stated goals . Hunt , by comparison to search , might suggest a more informed , purposive , focused , or relentless activity . Seek can give a more archaic flavor than search , except in set phrases . The verb can also indicate vague desires or high-minded aspirations . < Explore >  is like the aspect of search pertaining to activity that does not or cannot have a precisely stated goal in advance . Explore is much more clear-cut about this , however , since it always implies an attempt to learn more about an unknown . The action indicated by explore can , of course , have a stated general goal , but some sense of newness or unfamiliarity is always present in the verb . The remaining verbs all involve the notion of a thorough or meticulous search of an area for evidence or for something lost or presumed to exist . < Comb >  indicates a methodical , careful , minute , and orderly covering of possibilities , often giving a tone of desperation and sometimes implying a group search . < Scour >  compares with comb in thoroughness , but may suggest greater effort or intensity .

It derives from husk , referring to the tough covering shell of a seed ; also , its other uses pertaining to dryness , roughness , or hoarseness provide connotations here . While husky suggests largeness of frame , it is more emphatic about the strength or muscular density of physique , particularly of the torso , with suggestions of coarseness or toughness . Thus , it serves as an antonym to lithe or supple and implies instead a possibly slower but more powerful body . < Brawny >  and < burly >  both intensify the emphasis of husky on massive or dense muscular development , suggesting in these cases a grossness of build beyond that of any well-proportioned and cleanly defined athletic ideal . Burly may carry connotations over from another word , identical in form , that refers to the knots and burls of a tree , in this case suggesting a thick bunching of muscles that may verge on the grotesque ; an overall thickness of frame , at any rate , is implied , with suggestions of coarse or crude power that are even stronger than those for husky . Brawny is less extreme in its implications than burly , emphasizing instead the sheer power inherent in muscular development . Where husky may particularly point to a developed torso , brawny suggests general muscular density , such as that acquired through hard physical labor . < Beefy >  points to muscular masses but , unlike the previous adjectives , need not indicate power or density . Beefy can in fact suggest a fleshy grossness that may be repellent or flabby . < Hulking >  and < stocky >  both suggest sheer size or largeness of frame rather than pointing primarily to muscular development . Hulking particularly indicates a tall or looming male build . Stocky , by contrast , emphasizes largeness rather than tallness of frame . Even more than husky , stocky can be used euphemistically for a fat or heavy body . < Strapping >  combines the suggestions of sheer size in the last pair with the stress on muscular development in the first group .

Impulsive need not always imply recklessness , and in some contexts may only imply spontaneity and the lack of premeditation . < Headlong >  suggests a reckless disregard of consequences along with impetuous haste . Unlike the other adjectives here considered , headlong is used as both an adjective and an adverb ; it is somewhat more formal when used as an adjective . Where headlong points to a complete lack of deliberation , < precipitate >  suggests that what deliberation did occur was grossly inadequate to prepare for the ensuing action ; a precipitate action is therefore premature and rash . < Sudden >,  as here considered , suggests an abrupt or unexpected action but does not necessarily imply haste ; it does point to either a spontaneous , unpremeditated act or a perception for which one is not prepared .

When applied to mental attitudes , as in the latter example , stir up is close to < arouse >,  Arouse points specifically to awakening or opening one's eyes to a situation or point of view , whereas the more emphatic < rouse >  indicates a call to action or to vigorous opinion likely to lead to action . < Instigate >  and < foment >  usually suggest the setting in motion of events that in some way threaten or upset the status quo . These verbs will therefore convey a negative or unfavorable connotation to the extent that one deplores violent change . Instigate suggests an insidious design to bring about some drastic action . Foment suggests an attempt to keep people or conditions agitated in order to bring about radical change or to promote dissension and discord . Whereas instigate emphasizes the act of initiating the design , foment stresses keeping it alive . Instigate , in addition , has a wider range of use and can point to any design , even one of noble motive , whereas foment is used most often of underhanded designs aiming at radical change . < Provoke >  as here considered can be used , like instigate , to point to a variety of results , but it does not necessarily or even commonly imply conscious design .

Provoke emphasizes more strongly than the other verbs of this group the act that incites and its result . < Exhort >  means urge earnestly ; it suggests an attempt to persuade someone of a course of action by emphatic and even passionate argument or by appealing to that person's sympathy or conscience .

While inconstant can apply to a single betrayal of love , fickle applies to the inclination to move from one infatuation to another . Inconstant can sometimes refer more widely to anything showing variability . In wider uses , fickle still applies to the basic situation of loyalty . < Changeable >  and < erratic >  are much more general than the previous pair and are less disapproving in tone . Changeable can register the neutral fact that something is capable of change . Indeed , this capacity can be desirable .

Erratic points more to an uneven or arbitrary course . < Chameleonic >  is most comparable to changeable , < capricious >  to erratic , but both adjectives are alike in being more vivid than the foregoing and in being more exclusively concentrated on human characteristics . Chameleonic suggests the chameleon's ability , as a defensive camouflage , of changing color so as to blend with its background . Sometimes , chameleonic applies to human versatility in a neutral or approving way . More often , however , chameleonic suggests an insincere person willing to play any role that might offer momentary advantage . Capricious , which is exclusively negative in tone , need not suggest insincerity , like chameleonic , but it does stress an arbitrary and high-handed attitude in which unfair choices are made , not on the merits of a case , but on the basis of personal taste or whim . < Mercurial >  and < protean >,  alone of these adjectives , may suggest rapidity as well as frequency of change . Mercurial is most comparable to chameleonic , but where a negative tone preponderates in the latter's use , mercurial is more dependent on context to establish approval or disapproval . In favorable reference , it suggests a highly charged and energetic mental dexterity that is flexible to the demands of specific situations and responsive to opportunities for exploiting such situations . In negative uses , mercurial suggests an excessively volatile quickness and impatience that results in poor control and botched efforts . Protean refers to the ability of the demigod Proteus to change shapes as a way of eluding capture ; often , protean can function in both positive and negative ways . Most often , however , protean refers favorably to someone gifted with diverse abilities and skills , which are exhibited in a remarkable proliferation of accomplishments .

Improper is used often as a euphemism for indecent in the sense of obscene . < Indecorous >  is applied to conduct that does not conform to established conventions of formality and manners , conduct generally consisting of minor infractions for which any of the other adjectives in this group would be too strong .", "questionList": [{"question": "{_?_} remarks directed at passing girls ; ____ pictures ; an ____ proposal to engage in unusual sexual practices .", "options": ["immodest", "improper", "unseemly", "indecorous", "indecent", "indelicate"], "answer": "indecent"}, {"question": "____ remarks directed at passing girls ; {_?_} pictures ; an ____ proposal to engage in unusual sexual practices .", "options": ["immodest", "improper", "unseemly", "indecorous", "indecent", "indelicate"], "answer": "indecent"}, {"question": "____ remarks directed at passing girls ; ____ pictures ; an {_?_} proposal to engage in unusual sexual practices .", "options": ["immodest", "improper", "unseemly", "indecorous", "indecent", "indelicate"], "answer": "indecent"}, {"question": "After his wife died , he remarried with {_?_} haste", "options": ["immodest", "improper", "unseemly", "indecorous", "indecent", "indelicate"], "answer": "indecent"}, {"question": "Their appetite for gossip is absolutely {_?_} .", "options": ["immodest", "improper", "unseemly", "indecorous", "indecent", "indelicate"], "answer": "indecent"}, {"question": "Few people now find the bikini {_?_}", "options": ["immodest", "improper", "unseemly", "indecorous", "indecent", "indelicate"], "answer": "immodest"}, {"question": "My mother thinks my sister is {_?_} because she pursues boys .", "options": ["immodest", "improper", "unseemly", "indecorous", "indecent", "indelicate"], "answer": "immodest"}, {"question": "the {_?_} self-seeking of a social climber ; to brag in an ____ way about one's abilities .", "options": ["most immodest", "most improper", "most unseemly", "most indecorous", "most indecent", "most indelicate"], "answer": "immodest"}, {"question": "the ____ self-seeking of a social climber ; to brag in an {_?_} way about one's abilities .", "options": ["immodest", "improper", "unseemly", "indecorous", "indecent", "indelicate"], "answer": "immodest"}, {"question": "It is thought by many to be {_?_} to reveal one's salary", "options": ["immodest", "improper", "unseemly", "indecorous", "indecent", "indelicate"], "answer": "indelicate"}, {"question": "Subjects fit for the locker room are often too {_?_} to be discussed at the dinner table .", "options": ["immodest", "improper", "unseemly", "indecorous", "indecent", "indelicate"], "answer": "indelicate"}, {"question": "It is considered {_?_} for lawyers to discuss their clients ' affairs publicly", "options": ["immodest", "improper", "unseemly", "indecorous", "indecent", "indelicate"], "answer": "improper"}, {"question": "It would be regarded as {_?_} and ridiculous for a well-known philosopher to endorse the qualities of a patent medicine .", "options": ["immodest", "improper", "unseemly", "indecorous", "indecent", "indelicate"], "answer": "unseemly"}, {"question": "to make {_?_} advances .", "options": ["immodest", "improper", "unseemly", "indecorous", "indecent", "indelicate"], "answer": "improper"}, {"question": "Loud laughter during a wedding ceremony is {_?_}", "options": ["immodest", "improper", "unseemly", "indecorous", "indecent", "indelicate"], "answer": "indecorous"}, {"question": "She always felt {_?_} when she was obliged to straighten her stockings in public .", "options": ["immodest", "improper", "unseemly", "indecorous", "indecent", "indelicate"], "answer": "indecorous"}]}, {"wordSetString": "cajole,persuade,induce,urge,coax,wheedle", "original_discussion": "These verbs mean make one's will or views prevail over those of another . < Induce >  means get another to do something by appealing to reason . < Persuade >  is the most general verb and may be substituted for any of the others .

In general use , it may apply to anyone or anything that shows no mercy and cannot be stopped by entreaty or appeal . Specifically , relentless is sometimes used as an intensification of tireless . As such it can imply a refusal to yield under punishing pressure . Or it may focus on an implacable persistence in hounding another . Unrelenting may be less extreme in its implications , sometimes suggesting a proper rather than a cruel refusal to relent . An unrelenting person may not be impervious to entreaty , but he or she is able to resist , even in the face of temptation . Unrelenting may also suggest the unshakable resolve and fierce dedication of someone firmly committed to a cause and not to be turned aside by obstacles .

Inexorable , relentless , and pitiless may all imply a refusal or inability to make or allow the slightest concession . < Ruthless >  conveys a greater degree of harshness than any of the other adjectives , for it focuses on a fierce refusal to give any quarter . It is applied to persons who are so unsparing as to be cruel , driving forward single-mindedly and sometimes savagely , with brutal disregard for those they attack or exploit .

At its strictest , it refers to both the real estate and personal property ( including sums of money ) left to someone in a will . This is usually acquired upon the death of the person who made the will , although sometimes it may be reserved until the one receiving it reaches a certain age or meets certain conditions . Occasionally , inheritance may be used to indicate realty alone , especially an estate or family home . In a more general sense , inheritance refers to anything handed down by one's predecessors , from hereditary traits to cultural traditions . < Bequest >,  by contrast , functions solely in terms of willed personal property , often a sum of money , that comes to one by formal declaration upon the death of the donor . At their strictest , < legacy >  and < heritage >  contrast , since legacy refers like bequest to a willed gift of money or personal property , while heritage refers , more like inheritance , to real property that goes by right to an heir . More significantly , however , both nouns are similar in referring generally to anything that has come down from the past . In this use , legacy is likely to refer to abstract things such as qualities , attitudes , principles , or rights . Heritage has a particular pertinence to enduring concrete things such as monuments , buildings , or natural resources . In their strict senses , < patrimony >  refers to an estate , usually real , inherited from one's father , while < birthright >  can refer to property , real or personal , to which someone , especially a firstborn son , is entitled by birth . Much more commonly , however , both patrimony and birthright are used in more general senses . Here , patrimony can refer to anything derived from one's father or ancestors ; thus , it is a restriction of the general sense of legacy , referring to family or ancestral traditions . Sometimes , however , patrimony is used even more generally , like inheritance .

Inborn indicates those traits acquired before birth , inbred those traits acquired later through training . The split is not as neat as it appears , however , since inborn is not always clear about environmental influences during gestation , and inbred is not clear about the distinction between the contingent effects of environment during infancy and later training . < Congenital >  presents a conflicting set of meanings that render it vague and open to misinterpretation . In its most specific sense , it refers to traits acquired during gestation and not through heredity or later training . In a completely contrary meaning , however , congenital refers to traits acquired at any time from birth onwards . In this instance , it would seem clearer to use habitual or some other word .

In its strictest sense , a judge is a government official who presides in a court of law and administers justice by hearing and deciding cases . By extension , judge is applied to a person who has the requisite knowledge , experience , and impartiality to make decisions or pass upon the merits of something . < Arbitrator >  and < arbiter >  are sometimes used synonymously to denote a person or one of several persons chosen by disputing parties to settle their differences . However , in this sense , arbitrator is the preferred term . Arbiter , a somewhat literary word , is more often applied to one who without official authorization or position has the prestige to make decisions or to set standards that others willingly follow . < Referee >  and < umpire >  may both mean arbitrator , but the two terms are more likely to be used in special contexts . Many sports are presided over by official judges who are appointed to enforce the rules of the game or contest and to settle disputed points . In baseball , tennis , and cricket , such an official is called an umpire ; in boxing , ice hockey , and basketball , referee is the correct term . The rules of American football call for the presence of both an umpire and a referee . Outside the world of sports , umpire and referee have further meanings . Referee is applied technically to a lawyer to whom a pending legal case is referred , by means of a court order , for additional investigation and report .

Jumble suggests physical disorderliness , a lack of neatness , and brings to mind objects strewn about carelessly . Muddle suggests the lack of clear or coherent organization and commonly refers to mental or intellectual disorder -- confused thinking . < Conglomeration >  and < melange >  refer to heterogeneous collections of things . Both often carry critical overtones , suggesting that the collection is random or inapposite . Melange more vigorously suggests inaptness or incongruity and is sometimes used derisively or contemptuously . < Medley >  and < farrago >  both refer to confused mixtures or masses of elements .

A medley is necessarily various , but not necessarily composed of inharmonious or clashing elements .

Knitting involves the use of two large , slightly pointed needles ( or a knitting machine ) on which a series of interlacing loops are made into successive rows , the resulting fabric being transferred from one needle to the other at the beginning of each new row of stitches .

In weaving fabrics , threads are entwined into a texture by interlacing on a loom two sets of strands , the warp and the weft ( sometimes called woof ) that are at right angles to one another . The warp threads , which run the long way of the fabric , are strung tightly on the loom ; the weft threads are then passed back and forth , and over and under the warp by means of a shuttle .

Shortage also means the amount by which something is deficient . < Dearth >  in a sense no longer used meant dearness or costliness .

A rawboned person has a prominent bone structure and little flesh , but may be sturdily made though spare and angular . Rawboned carries the suggestion of crudity in build , of sharp or knobby bones jutting out . The last two adjectives focus on abnormal leanness rather than a naturally lanky or bony build . < Spindling >  describes a form so long and thin that it seems markedly out of proportion . < Spindly >  adds to spindling the suggestion of physical weakness and frailty , describing a combination of height or length and matchstick thinness .

Big suggests something of more than normal size , but it is particularly relevant to material or bodily mass , whereas large might suggest even greater departure from a norm . In this case , the implications of the adjective are less limited to the physical . < Outsize >  ( or outsized ) specifically suggests something too large to conform to the norm or be accommodated by an already established measure . While the adjective thus suggests an object of abnormal or excessive size , unusual mass is not necessarily implied . < King-size >  is a merchandising term that refers to a product that is longer or larger than the standard or usual size . < Gigantic >  and < mammoth >  are now mostly used as hyperboles , suggesting anything of extreme proportions . Gigantic derives from a Latin word for giant ; mammoth , of course , can refer to the prehistoric ele-phantlike animal . Mammoth in the present context still may more readily suggest something physically big , whereas gigantic is more often used now for metaphorical instances . But this is by no means invariable . < Giant >  differs from gigantic in often suggesting a physical change of scale or in referring to something reproduced in outsized dimensions . As a hyperbole , it can be used indiscriminately .

Strict usage distinguishes constitutional from all the other terms because of its direct reference to a document , instrument , or body of rules acknowledged as paramount in determining what is lawful or legal . < Legitimate >  originally meant whatever was declared to be lawful .

It may be applied to families , referring to connection through marriage , but it is more often used of formal agreements between nations . In this latter sense , alliance implies that the nations involved surrender little or no sovereignty in banding together and that they are free to withdraw at any time . In a defensive alliance , all participating nations might agree to fight an aggressor if that aggressor attacked any one of them .

The central government may be largely confined to the direction of foreign affairs . In 1781 , the American colonies adopted the Articles of Confederation , which bound them together in a league of common defense until 1789 , when the ratified Constitution established a stronger federal government . Under the original confederation , each state retained its sovereignty , and the federal government was subordinate to the states , its powers being severely limited and restricted . Later , in 1861 , the constitution of the Southern Confederacy was adopted ; it was similar to the U . S . Constitution but differed in its emphasis on states' rights . A <federation>  is a league formed by independent states , clubs , or organizations that delegate part of their sovereignty to a central authority . In political terms , a federation is a single government formed from separate states or from separate local governments . Although the states retain jurisdiction over their own internal affairs , the central government has stronger powers than one established under a confederacy or confederation and is able to deal authoritatively both with the state governments and with the citizens of the states . The United States is a federation , and a closely knit federation is a < union >,  Union , like alliance , applies to the joining together of two persons in wedlock rather than to the consequent connection of their families .

And unlike the other words , it may involve a fast , heavy , or steady flow as well as a slow , slight , or intermittent one . < Drip >  means fall in drops or let liquid fall in drops . Something that drips may be leaking or overflowing . A paper bag may drip when a container in the bag is leaking . Drip may also designate the sound of liquid falling drop by drop . Where drip implies a broken , staccato movement , < trickle >  is used of liquid that runs gently . It indicates a slow fall or slight flow of liquid , either drop by drop or in a fine , thin stream . Fluid may drip or trickle either from a leak that was unforeseen or from an opening designed for the discharge of liquid . And trickle often suggests either that a flow has not been fully started or that it is petering out . < Ooze >  indicates a slow leakage or a sluggish flow , as of a liquid squeezing out in droplets through small openings . In an extended sense , ooze may be applied to any similar seepage . And it sometimes refers to the unctuous flow or easy movement of a substance that is thick and slippery . In a figurative sense , leak refers to an unofficial or unauthorized divulging of information . Trickle may indicate movement in a very small stream , one thing or one person at a time . M . The trickle-down theory presumes that benefits bestowed on those at the top of the economic ladder will gradually make their way down to those at the bottom . Trickle may also apply to an uncertain , rippling sound suggestive of trickling water . Ooze sometimes indicates the slow , silent escape of some vital quality . It may also imply the exuding of something as if through the pores .

The negative force of pedantry , of course , suggests that such details are dogmatically exploited for their own sake as a pharisaical display , without regard for their relevance to important concerns or problems .", "questionList": [{"question": "book {_?_} ; the ____ required to understand the obscure allusions of some poets .", "options": ["knowledge", "erudition", "scholarship", "pedantry", "learning"], "answer": "learning"}, {"question": "book ____ ; the {_?_} required to understand the obscure allusions of some poets .", "options": ["knowledge", "erudition", "scholarship", "pedantry", "learning"], "answer": "learning"}, {"question": "patterns of {_?_} in young children .", "options": ["knowledge", "erudition", "scholarship", "pedantry", "learning"], "answer": "learning"}, {"question": "libraries where accumulates all the {_?_} of the ages .", "options": ["knowledge", "erudition", "scholarship", "pedantry", "learning"], "answer": "learning"}, {"question": "struggles to increase our {_?_} of the universe .", "options": ["knowledge", "erudition", "scholarship", "pedantry", "learning"], "answer": "knowledge"}, {"question": "a poor {_?_} of English grammar .", "options": ["knowledge", "erudition", "scholarship", "pedantry", "learning"], "answer": "knowledge"}, {"question": "She had a better {_?_} of human nature than the psychiatrist , for all his ____ .", "options": ["knowledge", "erudition", "scholarship", "pedantry", "learning"], "answer": "knowledge"}, {"question": "She had a better ____ of human nature than the psychiatrist , for all his {_?_} .", "options": ["knowledge", "erudition", "scholarship", "pedantry", "learning"], "answer": "learning"}, {"question": "students receiving special awards for {_?_} .", "options": ["knowledge", "erudition", "scholarship", "pedantry", "learning"], "answer": "scholarship"}, {"question": "the definitive book on the Civil War , marked by its authoritative data and flawless {_?_} .", "options": ["knowledge", "erudition", "scholarship", "pedantry", "learning"], "answer": "scholarship"}, {"question": "the {_?_} of scholastics busy refining Ptolemy while Copernicus and Brahe were altering the whole map of the heavens .", "options": ["knowledge", "erudition", "scholarship", "pedantry", "learning"], "answer": "pedantry"}]}, {"wordSetString": "let,lease,charter,rent,hire", "original_discussion": "These verbs mean get or grant the temporary use or possession of somediing , as a car , building , etc. , in return for a certain payment .

Less commonly , hire indicates the granting of personal service or temporary use . It is also employed when one wishes to designate paying for the temporary , exclusive use of another's vehicle , premises , or the like . < Charter >  is synonymous with hire in reference to vehicles , especially large public vehicles , as buses , airplanes , and trains . Charter , however , also designates a specialized kind of hiring done in connection with a contract called a charter party , an agreement under which the whole or part of a vessel is leased for the conveyance of goods . < Rent >  is usually applied to the paying of an agreed amount of compensation for the use of real or personal property during a specified time .

It may also suggest , however , casting off something in the course of a movement . Or it may suggest passing by something one has not been in actual contact with at all . < Go >  is even more general than leave and carries fewer connotations . In isolation , it stresses the act of moving away or passing along without reference to what one leaves behind . Go may also imply movement away from a place , position , or starting point , especially when it is used as a command or signal , as in a race . In contrast to leave , however , go sometimes stresses the destination of a movement rather than its point of origin . < Depart >,  like leave , emphasizes the starting point of a movement , though the destination is more often named ; it is also more formal than leave and may suggest a planned leaving rather than leaving on the spur of the moment . < Retire >  stresses movement from a relatively public place to a more private one . In a special sense , it means go to bed . Its formality' would make retire sound odd or antiquated in everyday conversation , except when it is used specifically to refer to the termination of one's active service or career . < Withdraw >,  if used in a sense similar to the general meaning of retire , would sound even more antiquated , but it has a viable use when it suggests retracing one's steps away from a recent advance .", "questionList": [{"question": "{_?_} the office ; ____ home ; ____ the party early .", "options": ["retiring", "withdrawing", "leaving", "going", "departing"], "answer": "leaving"}, {"question": "____ the office ; {_?_} home ; ____ the party early .", "options": ["retiring", "withdrawing", "leaving", "going", "departing"], "answer": "leaving"}, {"question": "____ the office ; ____ home ; {_?_} the party early .", "options": ["retiring", "withdrawing", "leaving", "going", "departing"], "answer": "leaving"}, {"question": "{_?_} behind a trail of banana peels .", "options": ["retiring", "withdrawing", "leaving", "going", "departing"], "answer": "leaving"}, {"question": "{_?_} one island after another in their wake .", "options": ["retiring", "withdrawing", "leaving", "going", "departing"], "answer": "leaving"}, {"question": "{_?_} forward through all sorts of terrain .", "options": ["retiring", "withdrawing", "leaving", "going", "departing"], "answer": "going"}, {"question": "Ready , set , {_?_} !", "options": ["retire", "withdraw", "leave", "go", "depart"], "answer": "go"}, {"question": "just {_?_} to the grocery store for some bread .", "options": ["retiring", "withdrawing", "leaving", "going", "departing"], "answer": "going"}, {"question": "{_?_} for Europe next Wednesday ; trains that ____ ( or ____ ' ) every hour on the hour .", "options": ["retiring", "withdrawing", "leaving", "going", "departing"], "answer": "departing"}, {"question": "____ for Europe next Wednesday ; trains that {_?_} ( or ____ ' ) every hour on the hour .", "options": ["retire", "withdraw", "leave", "go", "depart"], "answer": "depart"}, {"question": "____ for Europe next Wednesday ; trains that ____ ( or {_?_} ' ) every hour on the hour .", "options": ["retire", "withdraw", "leave", "go", "depart"], "answer": "leave"}, {"question": "{_?_} into the study , where they could talk freely .", "options": ["retiring", "withdrawing", "leaving", "going", "departing"], "answer": "retiring"}, {"question": "The housekeeper said my father had {_?_} for the evening .", "options": ["retired", "withdrawn", "left", "gone", "departed"], "answer": "retired"}, {"question": "an aging opera singer who {_?_} from the stage to teach voice .", "options": ["retired", "withdrew", "left", "went", "departed"], "answer": "retired"}, {"question": "the battalion that {_?_} from positions seized the night before ; ____ from her exposed vantage point at the uncurtained window .", "options": ["retired", "withdrew", "left", "went", "departed"], "answer": "withdrew"}, {"question": "the battalion that ____ from positions seized the night before ; {_?_} from her exposed vantage point at the uncurtained window .", "options": ["retiring", "withdrawing", "leaving", "going", "departing"], "answer": "withdrawing"}]}, {"wordSetString": "leave,desert,forsake,abandon", "original_discussion": "These verbs all mean quit a person , place , pursuit , party , or principle . < Leave >,  the most general , is relatively free of the connotations that cling to the others . It is often used noncommittally to indicate a physical departure . Leave in itself gives no hint as to the motives behind or consequences of a departure . One person may leave a country to evade prosecution for a crime , while another may leave it merely to seek a milder climate . Leave may also refer in a more abstract sense to the termination of a connection or association . In other uses , leave may be closely synonymous with the other verbs in this group , though all the others are more emotionally freighted . < Abandon >  denotes a complete giving up , especially of what one has previously been interested in or responsible for . It points to total relinquishment or withdrawal , sometimes under pressure of circumstances or in breach of duty . A person may rightly or wrongly abandon an attempt or an idealistic dream after encountering difficulties . A scientist may abandon an unpromising project to engage in more useful and rewarding research . A captain may give orders to abandon ship when die ship is sinking . A military commander may justifiably abandon an exposed position , but to abandon his troops or his post would be reprehensible . < Desert >  adds to abandon the idea that a legal or moral obligation or trust is being violated . It means abandon a post , duty , relationship , or loyalty in violation of one's faith , oath , responsibility , or orders . Leave , abandon , and desert are all applied to marital or family relationships but often differ in their implications . A man who leaves his wife may do so openly and may still contribute to her support . A mother who abandons her child utterly relinquishes personal responsibility , consigning the fate of the child to chance or to other people . A man who deserts his wife and children willfully abandons them , without legal justification , with the intent to renounce entirely all legal and moral obligation . In a specific , intransitive sense , desert means leave military service without permission and with the intention of not returning . Leave , by contrast , may indicate no more than a temporary departure , while abandon may point to a position that has been left . The past participles abandoned and deserted both emphasize the result of a departure , pointing to the condition of the place left empty or the plight of the person left alone . < Forsake >  implies breaking off a close personal attachment and may refer to a spiritual as well as to a physical desertion . It often involves the letting down of a loved one or dependent and may point to a lack of positive action as well as to a negative abandonment . Forsake may also mean give up something that once was cherished or that formerly was freely indulged in or enjoyed .", "questionList": [{"question": "He {_?_} his hometown and moved to the big city .", "options": ["left", "deserted", "forsook", "abandoned"], "answer": "left"}, {"question": "She {_?_} Berkeley but continued to live near the campus .", "options": ["left", "deserted", "forsook", "abandoned"], "answer": "left"}, {"question": "a recruit who {_?_} the platoon under fire ; a turncoat who ____ the party .", "options": ["left", "deserted", "forsook", "abandoned"], "answer": "deserted"}, {"question": "a recruit who ____ the platoon under fire ; a turncoat who {_?_} the party .", "options": ["left", "deserted", "forsook", "abandoned"], "answer": "deserted"}, {"question": "The sentry {_?_} her post for a few minutes", "options": ["left", "deserted", "forsook", "abandoned"], "answer": "left"}, {"question": "The soldier {_?_} his post and ____ .", "options": ["left", "deserted", "forsook", "abandoned"], "answer": "abandoned"}, {"question": "The soldier ____ his post and {_?_} .", "options": ["left", "deserted", "forsaken", "abandoned"], "answer": "deserted"}, {"question": "the helpless , forlorn figure of an {_?_} child ; an outpost ____ to the elements ; an ____ building falling into ruin , ____ desolate by all its former occupants ; a couple afraid to walk down a ____ street at night .", "options": ["left", "deserted", "forsaken", "abandoned"], "answer": "abandoned"}, {"question": "the helpless , forlorn figure of an ____ child ; an outpost {_?_} to the elements ; an ____ building falling into ruin , ____ desolate by all its former occupants ; a couple afraid to walk down a ____ street at night .", "options": ["left", "deserted", "forsook", "abandoned"], "answer": "abandoned"}, {"question": "the helpless , forlorn figure of an ____ child ; an outpost ____ to the elements ; an {_?_} building falling into ruin , ____ desolate by all its former occupants ; a couple afraid to walk down a ____ street at night .", "options": ["left", "deserted", "forsaken", "abandoned"], "answer": "abandoned"}, {"question": "the helpless , forlorn figure of an ____ child ; an outpost ____ to the elements ; an ____ building falling into ruin , {_?_} desolate by all its former occupants ; a couple afraid to walk down a ____ street at night .", "options": ["left", "deserted", "forsook", "abandoned"], "answer": "left"}, {"question": "the helpless , forlorn figure of an ____ child ; an outpost ____ to the elements ; an ____ building falling into ruin , ____ desolate by all its former occupants ; a couple afraid to walk down a {_?_} street at night .", "options": ["left", "deserted", "forsook", "abandoned"], "answer": "deserted"}, {"question": "He pleaded with his wife not to {_?_} her family", "options": ["leave", "desert", "forsake", "abandon"], "answer": "forsake"}, {"question": "to {_?_} one's friends by failing to go to their aid when they are in trouble .", "options": ["leave", "desert", "forsake", "abandon"], "answer": "forsake"}, {"question": "Arthur Rimbaud {_?_} poetry at the age of nineteen", "options": ["left", "deserted", "forsook", "abandoned"], "answer": "forsook"}, {"question": "Doubts led the nun to {_?_} her faith and ____ the church", "options": ["leave", "desert", "forsake", "abandon"], "answer": "forsake"}, {"question": "Doubts led the nun to ____ her faith and {_?_} the church", "options": ["leave", "desert", "forsake", "abandon"], "answer": "leave"}, {"question": "In the ceremony , the groom promised to {_?_} all others and cleave only to his wife .", "options": ["leave", "desert", "forsake", "abandon"], "answer": "forsake"}]}, {"wordSetString": "radical,leftist,left-winger,liberal,progressive", "original_discussion": "These nouns refer to those who favor changes , more or less drastic , in the political or economic system of a country . < Leftist >  and < left-winger >  arose as terms because in many European countries , conservatives are seated to the presiding officer's right , and their opponents are seated to the left . Most typically , a leftist might be someone who favors governmental solutions to social problems , favors the working class or the disadvantaged , and opposes unregulated business or the established powers of wealth and privilege . These views may extend to a belief in public ownership of the means of production or even to the belief in the necessity of a revolution to achieve social justice , as in some forms of socialism . The emotional tone of leftist would clearly depend on the persuasion of the speaker . It was more clearly taken as a pejorative in the recent past than at present . In a negative context , the noun may be used to imply that all leftists are revo-lutionists or extremists , which has given rise to such countering phrases as democratic leftist . At present , leftist appears with greater frequency in neutral description , even by those describing themselves . Left-winger , by contrast , was and still is largely pejorative and would be avoided except by those who condemn such stands . < Liberal >,  according to its etymology , pertains to someone devoted to freedom . In actual use , as opposed to conservative , it refers to someone who welcomes constructive change as a way of solving problems . Used as a political label in the recent past , liberal indicated someone to the left of a moderate and as such it could be used to express distrust or suspicion , if not the disapproval often implied by leftist . More recently , however , liberal has become almost synonymous with moderate to indicate someone who favors the present tendency to solve social problems through government action , provided no drastic alteration in the social structure is contemplated . Despite this shift in emphasis and because both major U . S . parties are middle-of-the-road , relatively few political candidates refer to themselves as liberals . Side by side with an approving use , a new pejorative use of liberal has emerged to criticize those who are seen as not going far enough toward solving fundamental problems . This use , of course , is favored by leftists . In Britain , liberal appears in the name of the party midway between right and left . Outside the political sphere , liberal can still refer in a wholly approving way to someone who favors tolerance , permissiveness , and constructive change , as in education and theology . < Progressive >  has at least twice appeared as part of a U . S . third party to the left of Democratic Party liberals . The term would usually imply a stance more activist than that of a liberal but one more moderate than that of a leftist . On the other hand , progressive can sometimes be used to indicate a militance of the left . Used more generally outside politics , progressive can suggest someone who is forward-looking and dynamic . < Radical >  is the one noun here that indicates an extremist stand , yet need not apply solely to extreme leftists . Often , however , particularly in historical discussion of the first half of the 20th century , radical can without qualification indicate a leftist who , unlike a liberal or progressive , wished to see drastic alterations in society , often by means of revolution . In other areas , radical indicates someone in favor of thoroughgoing changes in a system .", "questionList": [{"question": "His political opponent accused him of being the typical {_?_} who paid lip service to integrated education and open housing , but did nothing about them .", "options": ["radical", "leftist", "left-winger", "liberal", "progressive"], "answer": "liberal"}, {"question": "the Conservative Party , the {_?_} Party , and the Labour Party .", "options": ["radical", "leftist", "left-winger", "liberal", "progressive"], "answer": "liberal"}, {"question": "a {_?_} who favored the new curriculum ; those cardinals at the Ecumenical Council who became known as ____ .", "options": ["radical", "leftist", "left-winger", "liberal", "progressive"], "answer": "liberal"}, {"question": "a ____ who favored the new curriculum ; those cardinals at the Ecumenical Council who became known as {_?_} .", "options": ["radicals", "left-wingers", "liberals", "progressives", "leftists"], "answer": "liberals"}, {"question": "the {_?_} Labor Party .", "options": ["radical", "leftist", "left-winger", "liberal", "progressive"], "answer": "progressive"}, {"question": "a {_?_} businessman who had contributed to many community and civic programs .", "options": ["radical", "leftist", "left-winger", "liberal", "progressive"], "answer": "progressive"}, {"question": "{_?_} of both the right and left .", "options": ["radicals", "left-wingers", "liberals", "progressives", "leftists"], "answer": "radicals"}, {"question": "a freewheeling debate among Trotskyists , Wobblies , and other {_?_} .", "options": ["radicals", "left-wingers", "liberals", "progressives", "leftists"], "answer": "radicals"}, {"question": "{_?_} who propose that colleges abandon the grading system , the giving of degrees , and the assigning of required courses .", "options": ["radicals", "left-wingers", "liberals", "progressives", "leftists"], "answer": "radicals"}]}, {"wordSetString": "permissive,merciful,lax,indulgent,tolerant,lenient", "original_discussion": "These adjectives describe a flexible or complaisant attitude that shuns applying rules too strictly or that is more generous than standards of discipline or conduct might allow if interpreted literally . < Lenient >  indicates a generous or indifferent lowering of standards , especially in the context of discipline meted out by a superior . It is the most neutral of these adjectives in its impheations , although it can easily take on a tone of either mild approval or mild disapproval . < Merciful >  and < lax >  are distinct from all these other adjectives in adding to the general meaning an extreme emotional tone . They contrast sharply with each other as well , merciful regarding the lenient attitude from a strongly favorable viewpoint , lax from nearly as strong a negative viewpoint . Merciful furthermore suggests compassion , lax laziness , indifference , or slipshod incompetence . < Indulgent >  is seldom neutral . It can carry a mild positive charge , suggesting generosity , in a context pertaining to affectionate relationships ; sometimes in such a context , however , and in most other uses , it is more strongly negative , suggesting undiscriminating or irresponsible complaisance . < Tolerant >  is far less emotionally charged , approaching neutral description in most uses . In addition to indicating a flexible attitude toward rules or standards , it can suggest approval for an open-minded reluctance to make hasty judgments or disapproval for condescending rather than equal treatment . < Permissive >  is a much more formal adjective than the others , referring descriptively to an educational approach that permits a child's interest and capacities to determine course content and rate of progress . Less specifically , permissive may refer to an extremely lenient way of child rearing . Partisans of a permissive approach , in either context , might use the term in neutral description , but critics of this approach may well use permissive as a pejorative label . Outside the contexts of education and psychology , permissive is widely used as a synonym for tolerant , but goes beyond the latter in suggesting not only open-minded detachment but a passive acceptance of involvement as well .", "questionList": [{"question": "a prep school that was more {_?_} than most toward minor infractions of the rules ; arguing that regimentation militates against learning , while ____ approval assists it ; He lacked a sense of responsibility because of his ____ upbringing .", "options": ["permissive", "merciful", "lax", "indulgent", "tolerant", "lenient"], "answer": "lenient"}, {"question": "a prep school that was more ____ than most toward minor infractions of the rules ; arguing that regimentation militates against learning , while {_?_} approval assists it ; He lacked a sense of responsibility because of his ____ upbringing .", "options": ["permissive", "merciful", "lax", "indulgent", "tolerant", "lenient"], "answer": "lenient"}, {"question": "a prep school that was more ____ than most toward minor infractions of the rules ; arguing that regimentation militates against learning , while ____ approval assists it ; He lacked a sense of responsibility because of his {_?_} upbringing .", "options": ["permissive", "merciful", "lax", "indulgent", "tolerant", "lenient"], "answer": "lenient"}, {"question": "He implored the judge to be {_?_}", "options": ["permissive", "merciful", "lax", "indulgent", "tolerant", "lenient"], "answer": "merciful"}, {"question": "The book's worth was invalidated by its {_?_} standards of accuracy", "options": ["permissive", "merciful", "lax", "indulgent", "tolerant", "lenient"], "answer": "lax"}, {"question": "When the spirit and letter of the law appear to be in conflict , a judge is {_?_} , not ____ , in upholding the spirit .", "options": ["permissive", "merciful", "lax", "indulgent", "tolerant", "lenient"], "answer": "merciful"}, {"question": "When the spirit and letter of the law appear to be in conflict , a judge is ____ , not {_?_} , in upholding the spirit .", "options": ["permissive", "merciful", "lax", "indulgent", "tolerant", "lenient"], "answer": "lax"}, {"question": "a jolly , {_?_} uncle ; too ____ of her children's every caprice or tantrum ; a magazine ____ of the unexamined prejudices and meretricious tastes of its readers .", "options": ["permissive", "merciful", "lax", "indulgent", "tolerant", "lenient"], "answer": "indulgent"}, {"question": "a jolly , ____ uncle ; too {_?_} of her children's every caprice or tantrum ; a magazine ____ of the unexamined prejudices and meretricious tastes of its readers .", "options": ["permissive", "merciful", "lax", "indulgent", "tolerant", "lenient"], "answer": "indulgent"}, {"question": "a jolly , ____ uncle ; too ____ of her children's every caprice or tantrum ; a magazine {_?_} of the unexamined prejudices and meretricious tastes of its readers .", "options": ["permissive", "merciful", "lax", "indulgent", "tolerant", "lenient"], "answer": "indulgent"}, {"question": "She informed her students that she could be {_?_} of those who fell asleep in class provided they did n't snore ; ____ of the attitudes and beliefs of others ; ____ of but not enthusiastic about the latest fads .", "options": ["permissive", "merciful", "lax", "indulgent", "tolerant", "lenient"], "answer": "tolerant"}, {"question": "She informed her students that she could be ____ of those who fell asleep in class provided they did n't snore ; {_?_} of the attitudes and beliefs of others ; ____ of but not enthusiastic about the latest fads .", "options": ["permissive", "merciful", "lax", "indulgent", "tolerant", "lenient"], "answer": "tolerant"}, {"question": "She informed her students that she could be ____ of those who fell asleep in class provided they did n't snore ; ____ of the attitudes and beliefs of others ; {_?_} of but not enthusiastic about the latest fads .", "options": ["permissive", "merciful", "lax", "indulgent", "tolerant", "lenient"], "answer": "tolerant"}, {"question": "the {_?_} theories of progressive education .", "options": ["permissive", "merciful", "lax", "indulgent", "tolerant", "lenient"], "answer": "permissive"}, {"question": "The children of {_?_} parents often give their own children an authoritarian upbringing , and vice versa .", "options": ["permissive", "merciful", "lax", "indulgent", "tolerant", "lenient"], "answer": "permissive"}, {"question": "{_?_} theories that resulted , at best , in well-adjusted ignoramuses .", "options": ["permissive", "merciful", "lax", "indulgent", "tolerant", "lenient"], "answer": "permissive"}]}, {"wordSetString": "lessen,allay,mitigate,alleviate,soften,lighten,assuage,temper", "original_discussion": "These verbs all indicate the act of reducing the intensity or severity of something . < Lessen >  is the most informal of these and the most general , applying both to a decrease in intensity and severity . It often suggests the subtracting of a part from a whole , as in its legal use . But lessen can apply neutrally to any reduction in degree or quantity . < Lighten >  is metaphorically graphic in referring to a decrease in the weight of something ; < soften >  is comparably graphic in referring to a decrease in the harshness , roughness , or force of something . Both are often more favorable in their impheations than lessen . Lighten would apply most naturally where an existing burden is partially lifted , soften most naturally where the full impact of something is prevented from being felt . In this context , < temper >   refers to making something more moderate, that  is , more temperate . But another use of temper gives a diametrically opposed meaning , referring to the act of hardening or toughening something . Thus , unless the context is clear , the use of temper can result in confusion . The remaining verbs all emphasize a reduction in severity ; they are also alike in pointing to the reduction or removal of something negative or undesirable , rather than the mere subtraction of one amount from another . < Allay >  and < assuage >  can both refer to the calming or satisfying of desire or appetite , but whereas allay can often suggest a partial lulling or pacifying , assuage might better indicate something approaching satiation . In other uses , furthermore , where assuage remains more strictly tied to the notion of a need that requires satisfaction , allay can function more widely for any appeasing action . In the former example , allay would suggest less conclusive relief , whereas in the latter assuage would seem out of place . < Alleviate >  is closest to allay but is even more emphatic about partial relief ; it is also restricted to situations in which something is made easier to bear . Thus , it is a more specific and more formal intensification of lighten . < Mitigate >,  which comes from a Latin word meaning soften , can refer more formally to the partial lessening of need , pain , or hardship .", "questionList": [{"question": "an appeal to {_?_} the sentence of the condemned man .", "options": ["lessen", "allay", "mitigate", "alleviate", "soften", "lighten", "assuage", "temper"], "answer": "lessen"}, {"question": "The flight to suburbia {_?_} the number of middle-class families living in the city itself .", "options": ["lessened", "allayed", "mitigated", "alleviated", "softened", "lightened", "assuaged", "tempered"], "answer": "lessened"}, {"question": "technology that served to {_?_} the work load of factory employees ; an attempt to ____ the blow by telling her the good news first .", "options": ["lessen", "allay", "mitigate", "alleviate", "soften", "lighten", "assuage", "temper"], "answer": "lighten"}, {"question": "technology that served to ____ the work load of factory employees ; an attempt to {_?_} the blow by telling her the good news first .", "options": ["lessen", "allay", "mitigate", "alleviate", "soften", "lighten", "assuage", "temper"], "answer": "soften"}, {"question": "a sea breeze that {_?_} the noonday heat .", "options": ["lessened", "allayed", "mitigated", "alleviated", "softened", "lightened", "assuaged", "tempered"], "answer": "tempered"}, {"question": "young bodies {_?_} by rigorous exercise .", "options": ["lessened", "allayed", "mitigated", "alleviated", "softened", "lightened", "assuaged", "tempered"], "answer": "tempered"}, {"question": "an attempt to {_?_} their hunger by nibbling on roots and berries ; a huge dinner that ____ his ravenous appetite .", "options": ["lessen", "allay", "mitigate", "alleviate", "soften", "lighten", "assuage", "temper"], "answer": "allay"}, {"question": "an attempt to ____ their hunger by nibbling on roots and berries ; a huge dinner that {_?_} his ravenous appetite .", "options": ["lessened", "allayed", "mitigated", "alleviated", "softened", "lightened", "assuaged", "tempered"], "answer": "assuaged"}, {"question": "reassuring words that {_?_} her fear ; a codeine tablet to ____ the pain .", "options": ["lessened", "allayed", "mitigated", "alleviated", "softened", "lightened", "assuaged", "tempered"], "answer": "assuaged"}, {"question": "reassuring words that ____ her fear ; a codeine tablet to {_?_} the pain .", "options": ["lessen", "allay", "mitigate", "alleviate", "soften", "lighten", "assuage", "temper"], "answer": "allay"}, {"question": "early attempts to {_?_} conditions in mental hospitals that preceded this century's thoroughgoing reform of mental care ; drugs to ____ the pain of terminal patients .", "options": ["lessen", "allay", "mitigate", "alleviate", "soften", "lighten", "assuage", "temper"], "answer": "alleviate"}, {"question": "early attempts to ____ conditions in mental hospitals that preceded this century's thoroughgoing reform of mental care ; drugs to {_?_} the pain of terminal patients .", "options": ["lessen", "allay", "mitigate", "alleviate", "soften", "lighten", "assuage", "temper"], "answer": "alleviate"}, {"question": "programs to {_?_} the disruptive effects of slum living ; rehabilitative therapy to ____ the after-effects of strokes and heart attacks ; the judge's decision to ____ the sentence in light of the convicted person's previous record .", "options": ["lessen", "allay", "mitigate", "alleviate", "soften", "lighten", "assuage", "temper"], "answer": "mitigate"}, {"question": "programs to ____ the disruptive effects of slum living ; rehabilitative therapy to {_?_} the after-effects of strokes and heart attacks ; the judge's decision to ____ the sentence in light of the convicted person's previous record .", "options": ["lessen", "allay", "mitigate", "alleviate", "soften", "lighten", "assuage", "temper"], "answer": "mitigate"}, {"question": "programs to ____ the disruptive effects of slum living ; rehabilitative therapy to ____ the after-effects of strokes and heart attacks ; the judge's decision to {_?_} the sentence in light of the convicted person's previous record .", "options": ["lessen", "allay", "mitigate", "alleviate", "soften", "lighten", "assuage", "temper"], "answer": "mitigate"}]}, {"wordSetString": "roll,list,roster,register,catalogue,listing,inventory", "original_discussion": "The nouns < listing >  and < list >  refer to any itemized series of names , words , etc. , especially when recorded in a set order .

Lonely can also be used to describe an unfrequented or deserted place .

But its most pertinent sense here is move secretly or furtively , always with the implication of menace . The implied danger is often vague and ill-defined , which increases the suggestion of menace . < Slink >, < creep >,  and < steal >  all mean move quietly or furtively , but whereas slink and creep often suggest fear as a motive for remaining hidden , steal may suggest other motives . Slink often points to a sly , guilty , or abject attitude and suggests a cowering posture and fairly rapid gait . Creep , in its basic sense , means move with the body close to or touching the ground . As here considered , creep often suggests timidity or fear as a cause of slow , very deliberate movement , regardless of posture . But it can also mean any slow movement . Steal emphasizes the secrecy of a mission . Both steal and creep can be used figuratively . < Skulk >,  more than slink , suggests guilt or shame as a motive for passing unnoticed . But it may also suggest sober caution , even menace . Unlike slink or creep , skulk does not suggest any particular gait ; it may imply the hunched-over posture of one wishing to remain undetected , but no mental picture is invariably associated with it . < Sneak >  gives no clue at all either to posture or gait , thus emphasizing motive -- the wish to remain unnoticed -- to the exclusion of manner . Sneak can apply to trivial or innocent events as well as serious ones . It suggests mischief or cowardliness more often than menace , and unlike lurk seldom or never suggests the threat of criminal acts . < Prowl >  means roam about stealthily in search of prey or plunder . When applied to people , prowl can suggest danger or may emphasize only the predatory instinct . In the U . S . a police patrol car may be called a prowl car because unless responding to a call it typically moves slowly and in an apparently random manner , as an animal might while searching for prey .

Most concretely , < massive >  indicates a large mass , bulk , or weight . Weight or bulk need not be implied , however , when massive points instead to something imposing or impressive in scale , scope , degree , or intensity . In a medical sense , massive points to something extending over or affecting a large area . < Ponderous >  and < hefty >  are more restricted than massive in that both echo the stress on weight but put less emphasis on size . Relatively formal , ponderous points to heaviness that may be unwieldy or unbearable . More often this adjective is used abstractly of something overserious or solemn to the point of dullness . Ponderous can also suggest a heavy physical movement that is slow , tortuous , or lumbering . Relatively informal , hefty can refer more readily to physical heaviness , as of a physique . Its unique area of relevance is to something that is heavy but meant to be picked up and carried . < Huge >  and < enormous >  contrast with the previous adjectives in stressing size more than heaviness . In this sense , both can serve as superlatives for large , with enormous being the more formal of the two . In itself , huge may suggest a looming tallness or largeness of frame . Enormous suggests extension in space on a scale that goes beyond the implications of huge . Both adjectives can be used metaphorically for something serious , critical , or urgent . < Immense >  is Eke the previous pair in stressing size more than weight . Where immense refers to material masses , it suggests something of dramatically or surprisingly large scale . But , like enormous , immense frequently stresses extension in space , rather than mass . Often , immense relates to totally nonmaterial or spiritual entities , with the implication of proportions so great as to swallow up things of normal scale . < Vast >  concentrates exclusively on extension in space , with a complete absence of implications pertaining to weight or even to measurable or definable size . In comparison with immense , which can suggest three-dimensional largeness , vast more readily suggests two-dimensional extension .", "questionList": [{"question": "a {_?_} boulder .", "options": ["immense", "ponderous", "huge", "massive", "enormous", "hefty", "vast"], "answer": "massive"}, {"question": "a {_?_} painting ; a decision that was to have ____ consequences throughout the succeeding century .", "options": ["immense", "ponderous", "huge", "massive", "enormous", "hefty", "vast"], "answer": "massive"}, {"question": "a ____ painting ; a decision that was to have {_?_} consequences throughout the succeeding century .", "options": ["immense", "ponderous", "huge", "massive", "enormous", "hefty", "vast"], "answer": "massive"}, {"question": "{_?_} swelling .", "options": ["immense", "ponderous", "huge", "massive", "enormous", "hefty", "vast"], "answer": "massive"}, {"question": "pyramids made of {_?_} stones said to have been inched into place .", "options": ["immense", "ponderous", "huge", "massive", "enormous", "hefty", "vast"], "answer": "ponderous"}, {"question": "a {_?_} lecture on the immorality of our society .", "options": ["immense", "ponderous", "huge", "massive", "enormous", "hefty", "vast"], "answer": "ponderous"}, {"question": "shuffling forward with a {_?_} gait .", "options": ["immense", "ponderous", "huge", "massive", "enormous", "hefty", "vast"], "answer": "ponderous"}, {"question": "a {_?_} weightlifter .", "options": ["immense", "ponderous", "huge", "massive", "enormous", "hefty", "vast"], "answer": "hefty"}, {"question": "breathing heavily as she lifted the {_?_} briefcase .", "options": ["immense", "ponderous", "huge", "massive", "enormous", "hefty", "vast"], "answer": "hefty"}, {"question": "the {_?_} football player ; the ____ balloon they inflated for the Thanksgiving parade .", "options": ["immense", "ponderous", "huge", "massive", "enormous", "hefty", "vast"], "answer": "huge"}, {"question": "the ____ football player ; the {_?_} balloon they inflated for the Thanksgiving parade .", "options": ["immense", "ponderous", "huge", "massive", "enormous", "hefty", "vast"], "answer": "huge"}, {"question": "a {_?_} man dwarfed by an ____ room .", "options": ["immense", "ponderous", "huge", "massive", "enormous", "hefty", "vast"], "answer": "huge"}, {"question": "a ____ man dwarfed by an {_?_} room .", "options": ["immense", "ponderous", "huge", "massive", "enormous", "hefty", "vast"], "answer": "enormous"}, {"question": "the {_?_} problems that must be faced in checking the population explosion ; ____ questions remaining to be answered .", "options": ["immense", "ponderous", "huge", "massive", "enormous", "hefty", "vast"], "answer": "huge"}, {"question": "the ____ problems that must be faced in checking the population explosion ; {_?_} questions remaining to be answered .", "options": ["immense", "ponderous", "huge", "massive", "enormous", "hefty", "vast"], "answer": "enormous"}, {"question": "an {_?_} statue , fifty times life size .", "options": ["immense", "ponderous", "huge", "massive", "enormous", "hefty", "vast"], "answer": "immense"}, {"question": "early explorers who got lost in the {_?_} , uncharted Atlantic .", "options": ["immense", "ponderous", "huge", "massive", "enormous", "hefty", "vast"], "answer": "immense"}, {"question": "the {_?_} void between the Milky Way and its nearest galactic neighbor .", "options": ["immense", "ponderous", "huge", "massive", "enormous", "hefty", "vast"], "answer": "immense"}, {"question": "the {_?_} emptiness of the unending desert .", "options": ["immense", "ponderous", "huge", "massive", "enormous", "hefty", "vast"], "answer": "vast"}, {"question": "the {_?_} volume enclosed by the cathedral's domed nave ; the ____ lawns surrounding the castle .", "options": ["immense", "ponderous", "huge", "massive", "enormous", "hefty", "vast"], "answer": "immense"}, {"question": "the ____ volume enclosed by the cathedral's domed nave ; the {_?_} lawns surrounding the castle .", "options": ["immense", "ponderous", "huge", "massive", "enormous", "hefty", "vast"], "answer": "vast"}]}, {"wordSetString": "age,ripen,develop,mellow,mature", "original_discussion": "These verbs refer to the process of growing up or growing old . < Mature >  is the most formal of these ; in its most restricted sense , it indicates the natural attainment by a living thing of its adult or fullest form . Outside this strict but neutral reference , mature can register approval for the gaining of wisdom , experience , or sophistication , particularly when this process is not necessarily inevitable . < Age >,  unlike mature , need not refer to fruition or tempering ; instead , it more often refers to the changes that result from the passage of time . Age , in fact , can often refer to negative or destructive changes that occur as a living thing grows old . Mature is sometimes euphemistically substituted for age in this sense , as though the former's positive reference to fruition might soften the latter's presumed harshness in suggesting declining vigor . Age , however , can apply to processed products with favorable force . Here , it suggests valuable or desirable qualities that only time can impart . When applied to inanimate objects in general , age applies less positively to the attrition resulting from time's passage . < Develop >  is more like the first sense of mature in pointing to positive change in which an existing or rudimentary form is improved , evolved , or perfected . In referring to normal biological growth and change , develop can apply more generally than mature , since it can be used to refer to a part as well as a whole organism , and can indicate less ambiguously transitions other than the one culminating in adulthood . When develop does not refer to predictable biological change , it is more general in application , most often referring either to the improvement or detailed elaboration of something . < Mellow >  concentrates on aspects of mature and age that pertain to the tempering imparted by time or experience . It specifically suggests a reduction in harshness or the moderating of an extreme position . In this sense , mellow is more positive than mature and age , since it gives overtones of glowing warmth , mildness , and amiability . < Ripen >  is a less formal and more vivid term for mature , with the same reference to the attainment by something of its final or most developed form . At its most literal , ripen applies to fruit , describing the process that brings it to full flavor . Metaphorically , ripen often refers to the filling out or enlarging of a spatial form . Used in a more general way in reference to people , ripen often suggests not the attainment of adulthood but a mellowing process in later life ; here , like one sense of mature , it often points to a gain in wisdom , but is in less danger of being seen as euphemistic .

The meaning of a word , sign , or symbol is the idea it expresses , the object it designates , or the concept it conveys . Words may have both literal and figurative meanings , both of which can be expressed in definitions , but the meaning of a word in any given instance often depends upon the context in which the word is used . In less restricted usage , meaning may apply to anything expressed as a message or intent , whether verbally or in some other fashion . Meaning may also apply to motivation , purpose , consequence , or even justification . Finally , in its most abstract , connotative use , meaning indicates expressiveness , pointing to the presence of insights or intimations without specifying what they are . < Signification >  relates to specific meaning . It points to an official or agreed-upon meaning , one recognized and understood by all who are acquainted with a given word , term , or symbol . and oz. ; the signification of heraldic devices on a coat of arms ; the legal signification of the word incompetent . < Sense >  compares with meaning in a broad as well as a narrow application . It often points to different kinds of use or interpretation , implying that a word has two or more meanings or ranges of meaning , or that a text has two or more levels of meaning . Unlike signification , which is confined to a fixed meaning , sense may indicate a connotation or understanding . It may also refer to an overall meaning or impression . Something that makes sense conveys a clear , understandable , or logical meaning . < Import >  is less clear-cut than signification , indicating an intended meaning that may need interpretation . More than meaning , it indicates the grasping of an idea , pointing to someone's understanding of what has been suggested or expressed . < Implication >  applies to meaning that may have been hinted at but has not been actually stated or expressed in so many words . It emphasizes suggestiveness , referring almost exclusively to debatable possibilities of interpretation inherent in a statement , act , or situation . Implication is thus not nearly as certain as import , contrasting even more strongly with the precision and definiteness of signification . Nevertheless , the implications of a thing , read rightly , may be far more important to a proper understanding of it than its literal or surface meaning . < Significance >  is akin to meaning in its wider sense . It mingles meaning and importance , referring to the underlying ideas or implications that give a special relevance to words , deeds , symbols , or events .

In a concrete sense , it points to a device or contrivance used to carry out an action or perform an operation . In a broader , abstract sense , it refers to method , system , or technique . Ways and means are methods of accomplishing an end , and this phrase is sometimes specifically directed to governmental finance and fund-raising . Means may also be applied to persons and things considered in terms of their past , present , or potential usefulness . < Agency >  suggests causation and implies active intervention . Unlike means , it would not be used of a passive tool employed by others in their action . Instead , it indicates a force , operation , or process that on its own produces a certain effect . Applied to persons , agency often indicates a deliberate working or acting on behalf of others . An advertising agency , employment agency , or travel agency is a business that serves clients , acting in their interests and helping them attain their goals . < Instrumentality >  is much more formal than the foregoing but close to means in scope . It focuses on the instrument acting or being used to accomplish a purpose . The noun < medium >  has the greatest number of specific senses that relate to the overall concept of means -- all stressing the intermediate position of the means . Unlike agency , medium may refer to an intervening substance through which a force may act or in which an effect may be produced . Medium may also designate a means , technique , or vehicle of expression , or the material used for such expression . In a spiritualistic sense , medium denotes a sensitive person , often a woman , who goes into a trance so that spirits may supposedly speak through her , using her as a mouthpiece for communication with the living . Other senses of medium refer to a more active intermediary . Here , most commonly , medium is applied to modem channels of communication , often appearing in its plural form media . Radio , television , newspapers , and magazines are known as mass media . Television is an advertising , entertainment , and news medium . A modem communications medium itself -- the means , techniques , and effects of transmission -- may seem to some to be more interesting and influential than the material or message the medium conveys . In this case , it is no longer a medium in the strict sense of the word , but an end in itself .", "questionList": [{"question": "A hammer is a {_?_} of driving a nail", "options": ["means", "instrumentality", "agency", "medium"], "answer": "means"}, {"question": "A cab was his customary {_?_} of getting to the theater .", "options": ["meanses", "instrumentalities", "agencies", "mediums", "media"], "answer": "means"}, {"question": "the {_?_} by which a politician may extend power .", "options": ["meanses", "instrumentalities", "agencies", "mediums", "media"], "answer": "means"}, {"question": "The harnessing of falling water provides a {_?_} of generating electricity", "options": ["means", "instrumentality", "agency", "medium"], "answer": "means"}, {"question": "Statistical analysis is a {_?_} of arriving at a fairly reliable forecast .", "options": ["means", "instrumentality", "agency", "medium"], "answer": "means"}, {"question": "the House Ways and {_?_} Committee .", "options": ["meanses", "instrumentalities", "agencies", "mediums", "media"], "answer": "means"}, {"question": "She is our {_?_} of achieving victory", "options": ["meanses", "instrumentalities", "agencies", "mediums", "media"], "answer": "means"}, {"question": "art for art's sake as opposed to art as a {_?_} of spreading propaganda .", "options": ["means", "instrumentality", "agency", "medium"], "answer": "means"}, {"question": "Carbon dioxide is converted into oxygen through the {_?_} of plants", "options": ["means", "instrumentality", "agency", "medium"], "answer": "agency"}, {"question": "Corruption in government was exposed through the {_?_} of the press .", "options": ["means", "instrumentality", "agency", "medium"], "answer": "agency"}, {"question": "The dispute was resolved through the {_?_} of mediators .", "options": ["means", "instrumentality", "agency", "medium"], "answer": "agency"}, {"question": "Through the {_?_} of the Travelers ' Aid Society , the lost boy was found and returned to his parents .", "options": ["means", "instrumentality", "agency", "medium"], "answer": "instrumentality"}, {"question": "Copper is a good {_?_} for conduction of heat and electricity", "options": ["means", "instrumentality", "agency", "medium"], "answer": "medium"}, {"question": "Air is a {_?_} of sound .", "options": ["means", "instrumentality", "agency", "medium"], "answer": "medium"}, {"question": "For her , poetry was a congenial {_?_}", "options": ["means", "instrumentality", "agency", "medium"], "answer": "medium"}, {"question": "a sculptor whose favorite {_?_} is stone .", "options": ["means", "instrumentality", "agency", "medium"], "answer": "medium"}]}, {"wordSetString": "meddlesome,nosy,prying,interfering,obtrusive,intrusive,snoopy,officious", "original_discussion": "These adjectives describe someone who , without invitation , involves himself or herself in the affairs of others , or who hampers them with unwelcome attentions . < Meddlesome >  can suggest either of these situations ; if the former , unwarranted curiosity is implied ; if the latter , a self-important insistence on giving advice is masked as helpfulness . < Interfering >  makes no reference to curiosity , but otherwise is close to meddlesome , except that it is more neutral and may suggest a less disagreeable or self-righteous approach . < Prying >, < snoopy >,  and < nosy >  stress offensive curiosity to the exclusion of other meanings . The extremely informal snoopy and nosy can suggest an avidity for spying on others , gathering gossip , or soliciting personal information by posing leading questions . Snoopy may suggest a sneaky or stealthy approach in acquiring information . Nosy may indicate more forthright methods , suggesting the act of sticking one's nose into someone else's business . The more formal prying , however , goes further than either of these to suggest an absolute violation of privacy by any means whatever . < Officious >  is now generally taken to refer to some-one who , unasked , bustles about making arrangements , volunteering advice , offering unwanted services , or giving orders as though he or she were discharging official duties . This meaning gives officious a degree of specificity not present in any of its synonyms . < Intrusive >  may suggest a pushing of oneself where one is not wanted , or may point to undue curiosity . < Obtrusive >  is applied to a person who disrupts other people's affairs , either by calling attention to himself or herself or by making self-aggrandizing suggestions or officious offers .

It refers to any attempt to bring extremes together or to function as a form of communication between them . In this example , the impheation is that the intermediary can advise or show good will but not demand or order a settlement of differences . Mediate can also be applied to the divisive disagreement itself or to its resolution . In another use , mediate may indicate the occupying of a midway position between extremes . The verb may also be used to define the action of Unking or communicating . < Intercede >  stresses a coming forward to stop a dispute in progress from continuing or getting worse , although it does not necessarily suggest that such action will solve the dispute . Intercede is often used to suggest that a third party is being drawn into an argument in order to plead for one side or the other . < Interpose >  contrasts with mediate in suggesting a blockage of communication between hostile forces . It resembles intercede in that no solution need be applied , but the suggestion of stalemate is stronger . Again , like intercede , interpose may indicate entrance into a dispute on behalf of one side , although in this case the action is limited , by implication , to defense . < Intervene >  contrasts with these other verbs by suggesting from the outset a more self-interested attitude in disrupting a dispute , usually to favor one side or another . Intervene would not be likely to refer to a mere stoppage , but does often suggest an intensification of hostilities .

Calling a performance of a play mediocre means that the performance was neither very good nor very bad and suggests that one had expected it to be better . Mediocre , then , like the rest of these adjectives , is a relative term and , like most of the others , may be preceded by a qualifying adverb to emphasize its disparaging implications . < Ordinary >  and < commonplace >  are probably closest to mediocre in meaning , but ordinary is broader in application and usually expresses a somewhat less severe judgment . [ How was the book ? Nothing very exciting , just ordinary . ] Ordinary can also mean uneventful , in which case it connotes no disparagement at all . Commonplace stresses the disparity between one's expectation of originality or uniqueness and the disappointingly ordinary or vulgar reality . It often expresses the haughtiness or arrogance of one who has high standards or a keenly critical attitude . < Fair >  and < so-so >  are close synonyms . Both occur more often in speech than in writing and are thus somewhat more informal in tone than mediocre and ordinary . Depending on the context ( or tone of voice with which they are uttered ) , fair and so-so can range from cautious approval to moderate disgust . They are often deliberately used in a noncommittal way , as to conceal bad news or a low opinion , often out of politeness or from the wish to keep one's own affairs private . [ How do you feel now ? So-so ; How did you like the book ? Fair . ] Fair is also used as a rank in a grading scale . < Passable >  and < tolerable >  are examples of damning with faint praise . Passable suggests bare adequacy , expressing the attitude indicated by a shrug of the shoulders and \" Well , things could be worse . \" If something is passable , one makes do with it out of necessity rather than choice . Tolerable has a wider range of meaning than passable . While it may mean barely adequate , it does not always emphasize barely , as passable does , but may in fact emphasize adequate . When used to characterize someone's health , tolerable is informal and has a provincial or dialectal flavor . < Second-rate >,  when opposed to first-rate , is the most obviously derogatory of the adjectives in this group , but when it is used in a scale of values that includes even lower categories , it joins passable in being a backhanded compliment .", "questionList": [{"question": "Considering his reputation as a gourmet , the dinner he served was surely {_?_} .", "options": ["second-rate", "tolerable", "mediocre", "commonplace", "so-so", "passable", "fair", "ordinary"], "answer": "mediocre"}, {"question": "an {_?_} summer day , with a cloudless sky and the hum of insects in the air .", "options": ["second-rate", "tolerable", "mediocre", "commonplace", "so-so", "passable", "fair", "ordinary"], "answer": "ordinary"}, {"question": "It was a {_?_} observation -- anyone might have made it .", "options": ["second-rate", "tolerable", "mediocre", "commonplace", "so-so", "passable", "fair", "ordinary"], "answer": "commonplace"}, {"question": "excellent , good , {_?_} , poor .", "options": ["second-rate", "tolerable", "mediocre", "commonplace", "so-so", "passable", "fair", "ordinary"], "answer": "fair"}, {"question": "She did n't really like the hat , but it was {_?_} and could n't be exchanged", "options": ["second-rate", "tolerable", "mediocre", "commonplace", "so-so", "passable", "fair", "ordinary"], "answer": "passable"}, {"question": "The movie was {_?_} -- there were one or two good scenes , but the acting was bad and the plot fell apart near the end .", "options": ["second-rate", "tolerable", "mediocre", "commonplace", "so-so", "passable", "fair", "ordinary"], "answer": "passable"}, {"question": "It was a {_?_} salary , one you could live on if you knew how to keep a budget .", "options": ["second-rate", "tolerable", "mediocre", "commonplace", "so-so", "passable", "fair", "ordinary"], "answer": "tolerable"}, {"question": "He's a {_?_} writer , not fit to stand in the shadow of Hemingway or Faulkner", "options": ["second-rate", "tolerable", "mediocre", "commonplace", "so-so", "passable", "fair", "ordinary"], "answer": "second-rate"}, {"question": "It's a good {_?_} school , strong in some departments and weak in others , but certainly better than a great many other schools in this area .", "options": ["second-rate", "tolerable", "mediocre", "commonplace", "so-so", "passable", "fair", "ordinary"], "answer": "second-rate"}]}, {"wordSetString": "encounter,see,contact,get in touch with,meet", "original_discussion": "These verbs express the action of coming together with another or others . < Meet >,  the most general , has the widest range of application .

In some contexts , meet refers to a formal introduction or to the making of a new acquaintance . [ Have you met my mother ?

As given here , these four nouns form a gradual progression toward greater specificity and formality . Meeting can apply to every situation in which two or more people come together by accident or design for an encounter , whether brief or prolonged . It can range in application from trivial or everyday situations to the most portentous or official occasions . Gathering differs from meeting in its specific reference to a group of more than two people . It is like meeting in other respects , including its wideness of application . Conference has more formality than either of the foregoing . But , like meeting , it can imply a group of two or more people . Assembly implies a gathering of many people and tends to suggest a planned rather than an unplanned meeting ; the school's weekly assembly . It is also sometimes used to designate the lower house in as state legislature . < Assemblage >,  used as an exact synonym for assembly , would sound archaic . Even more important , it is often used currently in a pejorative sense . A < coven >  is an assembly of witches , especially a group of thirteen . When coven is used for a meeting of ordinary people , the tone is pejorative . The remaining nouns of this group are similar in being more specific than the previous ones and much more formal as well . < Conclave >, < congregation >,  and < convocation >  refer primarily to religious assemblies , though they can extend to other kinds of meetings as well . Conclave , most specifically , refers to the gathering of cardinals to elect a pope . Overtones of this use remain in more general applications , including solemnity , secrecy , and high purpose . Congregation is even more restricted in use , referring to the adherents of a religion who attend the same local church . In a narrow sense , congregation can designate those actually present at a given service , and in a broad sense , it can embrace all of a church's parishioners . Convocation implies a meeting called by a higher authority . Convocation is also used by university groups with no implication of being called together from above . < Congress >, < convention >,  and < council >  often refer to governmental or political bodies . On an international scale , a council may include delegates from many nations . In ecclesiastical terms , council may refer specifically to a clerical parliament called to decide matters of church doctrine and discipline . An international council , however , is more often a secular agency or body . On a national or local level , council usually indicates either an appointed advisory committee or an elected administrative or legislative unit . In either case , it implies a small , select group , whereas congress and convention suggest larger assemblies or gatherings . A council's meetings may be closed to the public , like those of a conclave and unlike those of a congress or convention . Purely private organizations may also use council in their titles . In all but the ecclesiastical use , a council consists of its members whether they are gathered in a meeting or not . Congress is narrower in application than council , being most commonly used in a governmental sense , particularly of an elected legislative body . Another meaning survives , however , in the names of some private associations . Congress may also refer to a formal meeting of the representatives of sovereign nations , having as its purpose the settlement of certain questions . Convention , in its political sense , refers to a scheduled meeting of delegates to pass resolutions and elect leaders ( or nominate candidates ) . Convention is also often used to refer to a state or national meeting of members from various local branches of a private organization , as a professional association , social club , or fraternal order . Business is conducted in this kind of convention , but many of these gatherings are looked on chiefly as social occasions . Where the term convention is typically used of national meetings , international meetings , as of scientists , are more often referred to as congresses .", "questionList": [{"question": "the weekly Cub Scout {_?_} ;

Tune may refer to the music , as distinct from the words , of a song . Often , tune suggests songs of less than the highest aesthetic rank . < Aria >,  derived from the Italian word for song , refers to any of the set pieces in traditional operas and oratorios .

Someone with such a charge may , consequently , be called either a minister or pastor , although of the two , only pastor is used as a title .

Microscopic literally refers to something too small to be seen without the aid of a microscope . Miniature , on the other hand , refers to something that is small but by no means invisible or even difficult to see with the naked eye . Miniature suggests most strongly the scaling down of something to small size , as a model . It relates , by derivation , to small-sized paintings and can still apply in this way .

But it may also describe a child ( and , of course , an adolescent or adult ) who is willful , intractable , immoral , or evil . < Delinquent >  as an adjective means neglectful in duty or obligation . This meaning is not often found in reference to children or young people , possibly because of the common use of delinquent in the expression juvenile delinquent , which is taken to mean a young person guilty of antisocial or criminal behavior . It is unfortunate that this expression , which is specific in tone and pejorative in connotation , is applied loosely to young people who are indeed not juvenile delinquents but merely mischievous , bad , or < disobedient >,  Disobedient is another broad word . It refers simply to a failure or a refusal to obey , but its connotations when used to describe a child are different from those applying to an adult . Very young children who are characterized as disobedient might instead be called mischievous or naughty ; they are rarely guilty of serious misbehavior , and their failure or refusal to obey is more an act of will than of reason .

Retiring intensifies this sense of shy , suggesting the habit of avoiding any scrutiny altogether , though not necessarily out of fear .

Modest here refers to an understated acceptance of good fortune or recognition , or to behavior that at least acts out such an acceptance . Unassuming emphasizes one aspect of this , suggesting that one does not wish or demand that other people treat one in any special way . Unpretentious suggests having no illusions about one's relative importance or refusing to inflate one's worth out of proportion to the facts . < Humble >  and < lowly >  relate to the meaning of modest that refers to something on a reduced scale .

Moles are usually congenital in origin and may be large or small , flat or protuberant , with some having sprouting hairs . Occasionally , they may be removed either for cosmetic reasons or as a precautionary measure if they grow larger or undergo any change in appearance .

Popularly called strawberry marks or port wine stains , such birthmarks are composed of clusters of small surface blood vessels and capillaries . No effective treatment is known for this type of blemish . < Nevus >  is the technical term for both mole and birthmark . < Freckle >  applies to one of a large colony of small , flat , brown or tan spots on the skin , which are not congenital .

Moral is now more often used in a quasi-religious sense , ethical in a quasi-legal sense . Moral might be thought to include this narrower sense of ethical , making the one term generic , the other specific , but moral has more and more come to mean personal conduct as set by an external code or standard , especially when such conduct does not affect numbers of people . Ethical , by contrast , is more and more taken to describe just and fair dealings with other people , not by the application of an external standard but by a pragmatic consideration of all aspects of a situation in light of experience .

Relocating , however , may be done voluntarily in connection with one's business or job . < Transfer >  is a more formal substitute for move , but it is useful to indicate a change of occupation or station within the same large grouping ; in this it is like one sense of shift . Transfer in itself suggests neither promotion nor demotion but merely change of function . The verb is also relevant for shifting that involves no actual movement .", "questionList": [{"question": "{_?_} the desk a few inches to get better light ; having the piano ____ upstairs .", "options": ["transferring", "shifting", "moving", "relocating"], "answer": "moving"}, {"question": "____ the desk a few inches to get better light ; having the piano {_?_} upstairs .", "options": ["transferred", "shifted", "moved", "relocated"], "answer": "moved"}, {"question": "{_?_} her hand to rest on his shoulder ; ____ about in her seat to get more comfortable ; branches ____ faintly in the breeze .", "options": ["transferring", "shifting", "moving", "relocating"], "answer": "moving"}, {"question": "____ her hand to rest on his shoulder ; {_?_} about in her seat to get more comfortable ; branches ____ faintly in the breeze .", "options": ["transferring", "shifting", "moving", "relocating"], "answer": "moving"}, {"question": "____ her hand to rest on his shoulder ; ____ about in her seat to get more comfortable ; branches {_?_} faintly in the breeze .", "options": ["transferring", "shifting", "moving", "relocating"], "answer": "moving"}, {"question": "{_?_} from Baltimore to San Francisco ; ____ from a ground-floor apartment to one on the third floor .", "options": ["transferring", "shifting", "moving", "relocating"], "answer": "moving"}, {"question": "____ from Baltimore to San Francisco ; {_?_} from a ground-floor apartment to one on the third floor .", "options": ["transferring", "shifting", "moving", "relocating"], "answer": "moving"}, {"question": "{_?_} the refrigerator so he could clean behind it ; ____ her legs so latecomers could get past her to their seats .", "options": ["transferring", "shifting", "moving", "relocating"], "answer": "shifting"}, {"question": "____ the refrigerator so he could clean behind it ; {_?_} her legs so latecomers could get past her to their seats .", "options": ["transferring", "shifting", "moving", "relocating"], "answer": "shifting"}, {"question": "{_?_} from his position as sales manager to one of the vice-presidencies ; ____ the state capital from an out-of-the-way town to a more centrally located city .", "options": ["transferred", "shifted", "moved", "relocated"], "answer": "shifted"}, {"question": "____ from his position as sales manager to one of the vice-presidencies ; {_?_} the state capital from an out-of-the-way town to a more centrally located city .", "options": ["transferring", "shifting", "moving", "relocating"], "answer": "shifting"}, {"question": "a tenement family that refused to be {_?_} .", "options": ["transferred", "shifted", "moved", "relocated"], "answer": "relocated"}, {"question": "If a better job were offered you in Cleveland , would you {_?_} ?", "options": ["transfer", "shift", "move", "relocate"], "answer": "relocate"}, {"question": "{_?_} from field work to administrative duties .", "options": ["transferred", "shifted", "moved", "relocated"], "answer": "transferred"}, {"question": "{_?_} his phone call to the personnel department ; ____ the money from her checking account to her savings bank .", "options": ["transferring", "shifting", "moving", "relocating"], "answer": "transferring"}, {"question": "____ his phone call to the personnel department ; {_?_} the money from her checking account to her savings bank .", "options": ["transferring", "shifting", "moving", "relocating"], "answer": "transferring"}]}, {"wordSetString": "occult,mysterious,mystical", "original_discussion": "These adjectives describe matters beyond the ordinary range of knowledge , perception , or understanding , with the added suggestion of things kept secret or hidden from all but a favored few . < Mystical >  emphasizes the idea of a direct , intuitive , deeply personal revelation , especially one of a spiritual or religious nature .

It also suggests a trusting innocence that has not yet been tested ; naive ideals may be appealingly or exasperatingly out of touch with hard facts , but a naive person is limited in experience , not necessarily stupid . < Unsophisticated >  is more specific than naive in suggesting a lack of worldliness , whether one is experienced or inexperienced ; unsophisticated may be used as praise or as criticism , depending on the user's attitude toward urbanity . Unlike naive , unsophisticated does not necessarily imply a willingness to trust . < Provincial >  suggests lack of exposure to experience , like naive , but implies most specifically a life remote from any metropolis or one sheltered from fashionable taste and ideas . Provincial , in emphasizing remoteness of place , need not suggest innocence . < Rude >  suggests an extremely unformed taste or character , possibly as a result of a provincial life , but it comes near suggesting uncivilized and illiterate , except in rare instances of positive use . The remaining adjectives deal with the manner in which rude , provincial , naive , or unsophisticated people may behave . < Ingenuous >  is closest to naive in suggesting someone who is overly confiding , unsubtle , or unwary . Unlike naive , however , this need not result from a lack of experience . It may be used in a positive sense . It may also be used critically . < Unaffected >  refers to unpretentious manners or spontaneous informality . While it is exclusively positive in tone , what one person might consider rude behavior , another might think unaffected . Also , unaffected manners might be considered the mark of urbanity , whereas provincial , naive , or unsophisticated people , by putting on airs unnatural to them , might exemplify the opposite of unaffected conduct . < Guileless >,  like unaffected , is wholly favorable in tone , but it refers less to the contrast between informality and formality than to a simple lack of deceitfulness ; a person with pretentious manners might still be guileless . Nor does guileless necessarily suggest trusting unwariness like naive , or eagerness to share confidences like ingenuous . Aside from its stress on honesty , guileless thus says less about a person than the other adjectives . Similarly , an urbane person and a provincial or unsophisticated person might or might not be guileless , but their ways of showing this quality or lack of it would differ markedly . < Artless >,  very like unaffected , once unambiguously referred to a winningly open and spontaneous manner .

Offer and < volunteer >  may both refer to a generous extending of aid , services , or a desired item . This generosity may or may not follow a specific request from someone who is , in any case , free to reject or accept the gift . When a request precedes the act of offering or volunteering , the implied situation is usually that of some-one asking one or more members of a group to perform a task . Those who volunteer agree by free choice rather than by submission to selection or command . Offer and < bid >  share the context of a competitive attempt to close a contract . Here , the very opposite of a generous and spontaneous giving is indicated . Usually , the act of bidding follows a request or invitation , but the bid would be accepted only if its terms were the most advantageous of those received . The one who offers or bids , however , is committed to the stated terms if acceptance follows . Offer , < propose >,  and < present >  all share the context of putting forward ideas or suggestions in argument or discussion . Propose can also be used in a contractual situation , as in proposing marriage , in which case no previous request is implied and no following acceptance or rejection is certain . But the one who proposes something is bound to follow through if accepted . In the context of argument or discussion , however , propose and offer indicate a much more tentative situation , implying that a course of action has been suggested or a new idea brought forward not so much to be accepted or rejected as to be explored and possibly shaped by further discussion . In any case , propose implies at least temporary advocacy of an idea , whereas present suggests a much greater tentativeness still ; indeed , a debater may present an argument for the express purpose of refuting it . Present also has applications comparable to offer that range outside the context of discussion . Both suggest humility in certain courteous phrases . Both may indicate bringing something forward for display or appreciation . Present and offer here suggest generosity , but if the public must pay admission to see what is displayed , these verbs can become unpleasantly self-congratulatory and euphemistic . < Proffer >  and < tender >,  now going out of fashion , were once used to suggest something proposed or offered in a deferential way .

It may indicate strictly chronological age , referring to the latter part of life . But it may also focus on the negative qualities associated with old age , as loss of health , strength , or motivating force . < Aged >  often indicates a longer life span than old , applying to persons of very advanced years ; it is more formal than old as well as more limited in application . Specifically , it often points to changes wrought by aging , suggesting physical decline , though not necessarily implying disability . In a social context , the designation home for the aged has largely replaced the plain ( or blunt ) term old folks' home ; the former may be preferred because it more easily suggests debilitation that might demand institutional care . < Elderly >  is more favorable than either of the foregoing . It is a polite term , often connoting the dignity rather than the weight of years . An elderly person has passed middle age but is generally regarded as younger than an old person , both in age and in vigor . < Superannuated >  and < senile >  stress the negative aspects of aging . Superannuated emphasizes the idea of being considered too old to continue in one's job . In a specific sense , a superannuated person is one who has been retired because he or she has passed an arbitrary age limit , such as sixty-five . In an extended sense , superannuated means too old to be useful or efficient and has a disparaging tone . Senile implies a much more marked incapacity or decline . A person may be aged or superannuated without being senile . Senile , from the Latin word for old , points to mental or physical infirmity accompanying extreme old age . Senile atrophy , for example , involves a wasting away of tissue and a consequent emaciation of the body . Most specifically , however , in general use , senile stresses the enfeebling effects of age on the mind . < Venerable >, < matriarchal >,  and < patriarchal >  stress the positive aspects of aging . Venerable emphasizes the reverence , respect , and deference owed to one's elders . It focuses on the dignity of advanced age , implying that the person held in reverence is worthy of veneration , as because of wisdom , position , or achievement . Venerable can also suggest a distinguished appearance . Patriarchal and matriarchal , respectively , mean like a patriarch or matriarch -- the leader of a family or progenitor of a community or group .

Old-fashioned can also suggest a change in technology rather than in taste . It does not necessarily imply that the out-moded or superseded thing in question no longer exists physically . Sometimes , old-fashioned can nostalgically describe something valued for its quaintness , its formality , or its wholesome simplicity . < Out-of-date >  and < passe >  share with old-fashioned an emphasis on an arbitrary change of taste and style .

Archaic may also suggest something old but still surviving ; in this sense , it implies a given period in the past and can be used solely to classify rather than to evaluate . In other senses , archaic refers to something extremely old and not now in general use ; in this case it can be a more formal or technical substitute for old-fashioned .

Obsolete , obsolescent , and archaic are all applied to words that are now seldom or never used . An obsolete word is no longer used either in speech or writing , usually because it has been supplanted by a different word . An obsolescent word , though still in use , is becoming obsolete . Much modem slang rapidly becomes obsolescent . Archaic words were current at some time in the past , and appear in literature and in the Bible .

At both extremes , however , it implies a prior formulation of ideas or conclusions regarding a matter in dispute or under consideration . At its most individual , it involves evaluation , indicating an expression of personal thought , feeling , preference , or taste . In a more conclusive sense , it may represent an expert judgment in a matter of objective fact or truth . In all cases , however , opinion is carefully distinguished from fact . An opinion may be held with confidence , but it still falls short of positive knowledge and is open to challenge . In a broader frame of reference , opinion may indicate prevailing ideas many people hold in common . At its most definite , it designates the formal announcement of the conclusions of a court . < Sentiment >  and < view >  relate to personal opinion and frequently appear in the plural . Sentiment stresses feeling rather than reason , often indicating an idealistic approach or emotional stand rather than a pragmatic one . It is now encountered only in certain contexts . View stresses the personal element , emphasizing an individual attitude , approach , or point of focus . < Impression >  and < estimate >  stress the element of uncertainty in venturing an opinion . An impression arises from external factors , whether it leaves its mark on the senses or the mind . It may indicate the first reaction of the mind , before the due consideration that warrants an opinion , and may imply a superficial view or conclusion . In other cases , impression may emphasize vagueness of recollection , or caution and uncertainty in stating a view . Unlike an impression , an estimate does not reflect an uncertain memory or mind ; instead , it involves a personal appraisal or a value judgment . An estimate is based on the pertinent facts available at the time , the implication being that other , unknown factors might enter in at a later stage . An estimate also involves a consideration of the different aspects of a thing , or a weighing of pros and cons , with the attendant possibility of error in judgment . < Belief >  and < conviction >  are examples of positive opinion . A belief is something accepted by the mind as being true without certain proof . It may either originate in the mind or be instilled in the mind by others . Belief has a wide range of application , embracing ideas , theories , philosophies , religious creeds or tenets , and superstitions . Belief itself may range from simple , unquestioning acceptance to deep emotional involvement . Sometimes , however , it may convey a lingering uncertainty . A conviction is a strong belief arising from a deep-seated feeling of certainty . Conviction often implies the overcoming of previous doubt or skepticism .", "questionList": [{"question": "What is your {_?_} of the latest fashions ?", "options": ["impression", "view", "belief", "sentiment", "estimate", "conviction", "opinion"], "answer": "opinion"}, {"question": "In the {_?_} of my doctor , I should be well enough to travel by next week .", "options": ["impression", "view", "belief", "sentiment", "estimate", "conviction", "opinion"], "answer": "opinion"}, {"question": "She sought the {_?_} of several experts , but even they disagreed .", "options": ["impression", "view", "belief", "sentiment", "estimate", "conviction", "opinion"], "answer": "opinion"}, {"question": "public {_?_} .", "options": ["impression", "view", "belief", "sentiment", "estimate", "conviction", "opinion"], "answer": "opinion"}, {"question": "the majority {_?_} of the Supreme Court , citing precedents and constitutional principles in support of the decision .", "options": ["impression", "view", "belief", "sentiment", "estimate", "conviction", "opinion"], "answer": "opinion"}, {"question": "His Fourth of July speech was full of patriotic {_?_}", "options": ["impressions", "views", "beliefs", "sentiments", "estimates", "convictions", "opinions"], "answer": "sentiments"}, {"question": "the {_?_} expressed on a greeting card", "options": ["impression", "view", "belief", "sentiment", "estimate", "conviction", "opinion"], "answer": "sentiment"}, {"question": "A competent lawyer will try to assess the {_?_} of a jury before launching a defense", "options": ["impressions", "views", "beliefs", "sentiments", "estimates", "convictions", "opinions"], "answer": "sentiments"}, {"question": "I agree with you -- those are my {_?_} exactly .", "options": ["impressions", "views", "beliefs", "sentiments", "estimates", "convictions", "opinions"], "answer": "sentiments"}, {"question": "In my {_?_} , the scheme seems unworkable", "options": ["impression", "view", "belief", "sentiment", "estimate", "conviction", "opinion"], "answer": "view"}, {"question": "a newsletter monitoring congressional {_?_} on abortion", "options": ["impressions", "views", "beliefs", "sentiments", "estimates", "convictions", "opinions"], "answer": "views"}, {"question": "a novel-ist's {_?_} of society .", "options": ["impression", "view", "belief", "sentiment", "estimate", "conviction", "opinion"], "answer": "view"}, {"question": "the danger of judging on the basis of first {_?_} .", "options": ["impressions", "views", "beliefs", "sentiments", "estimates", "convictions", "opinions"], "answer": "impressions"}, {"question": "My {_?_} is that she was lying , but I could n't swear to it", "options": ["impression", "view", "belief", "sentiment", "estimate", "conviction", "opinion"], "answer": "impression"}, {"question": "He had the {_?_} they had met before .", "options": ["impression", "view", "belief", "sentiment", "estimate", "conviction", "opinion"], "answer": "impression"}, {"question": "The final bill was considerably higher than the con-tractor's {_?_} .", "options": ["impression", "view", "belief", "sentiment", "estimate", "conviction", "opinion"], "answer": "estimate"}, {"question": "After reviewing her first batch of work , what is your {_?_} of her ability", "options": ["impression", "view", "belief", "sentiment", "estimate", "conviction", "opinion"], "answer": "estimate"}, {"question": "a critical {_?_} of Henry James .", "options": ["impression", "view", "belief", "sentiment", "estimate", "conviction", "opinion"], "answer": "estimate"}, {"question": "a child's {_?_} that monsters lurk in the dark ;

Enemy can , however , suggest opposition without hostility , or merely a feeling of dislike .

In terms of something well cared for , it refers more to places or things than to personal appearance . Orderly suggests a considerable mass of details that without deliberate efforts at arrangement can easily become disarrayed . Clarity may be the motivating factor behind such an effort . But the adjective can indicate superficial rather than meaningful arrangement . < Tidy >  need not imply the arrangement of as many details as orderly , but it does suggest greater adherence to the arrangement chosen , even to the point of possible severity or rigidity .

Unlike the previous pair , however , neat applies as well to personal appearance as to places and things . In any case it suggests careful , uncluttered arrangements or simple , fastidious grooming . But neat , like the preceding adjectives , need not imply cleanliness , as can be seen from the phrase neat and clean . Something may be carefully arranged and yet not clean , although the two often go hand in hand . < Trim >  contrasts with orderly by emphasizing a sparseness rather than a quantity of detail ; it also points to simplicity , compactness , and precision . In reference to physique , trim suggests an appealing slimness . Both < trig >  and < natty >  apply mainly to personal appearance , particularly to clothing .

A greater reshaping of details is also suggested when arrange refers to the creation of music to accompany a melody or singer . < Order >,  like organize , can point to a thoroughgoing shaping and reshaping of elements , but in this context is more formal and can be confused with its more common use referring to the requisition of something . Nevertheless , order can function , especially in an aesthetic context , to refer to one aspect of the creative process . < Classify >  refers to a categorizing process that at its most mechanical stands in sharp contrast to the creative acts that organize and order suggest . Classify , however , can sometimes refer to the creating of the categories themselves . At its mildest , classify can indicate the identifying of examples according to existing types , possibly with no actual arranging or rearranging whatsoever . < Sort >  suggests the selection of items according to type ; this process is closely related to the categorizing process indicated by classify .

It may point to status gained on other grounds entirely , or merely suggest familiarity to a wide audience . < Dominant >  dwells mostly on causative force or a position of power . < Paramount >  strictly suggests a singular superiority rather than a most important excellence out of many -- or even out of a few . In many contexts , however , paramount might be thought excessively formal . < Predominant >  and < preponderant >,  on the other hand , imply a narrower advantage over the nearest contenders . Predominant suggests a recent ascendancy or points to a factor that is closely related to other factors almost as important ; the era when religious tolerance became predominant ; an electorate for whom the issues are the predominant consideration out of many extraneous factors vying for their attention . Predominant is less often used to refer to people ; in comparison with the power and control suggested by dominant , it suggests less clearly defined or less decisive factors . Preponderant may function similarly to predominant , but it may specifically suggest quantity rather than ascendancy . < Prevailing >  is closely related to predominant and preponderant , but it suggests an ascendancy that , while usual , is by no means uninterrupted or continuous . It may also suggest a consensus that is decisive but far from unanimous .", "questionList": [{"question": "an {_?_} scientist of the past century .", "options": ["dominant", "outstanding", "distinguished", "preponderant", "predominant", "foremost", "paramount", "prominent", "prevailing"], "answer": "outstanding"}, {"question": "the {_?_} impression of squalor that the town left us with .", "options": ["dominant", "outstanding", "distinguished", "preponderant", "predominant", "foremost", "paramount", "prominent", "prevailing"], "answer": "outstanding"}, {"question": "frustration as the {_?_} cause of the prison riots .", "options": ["dominant", "outstanding", "distinguished", "preponderant", "predominant", "foremost", "paramount", "prominent", "prevailing"], "answer": "outstanding"}, {"question": "the {_?_} interpreter of Bach ;

Specifically , an ox is an adult castrated male animal , once widely used to pull carts and plows but now common only in agrarian economies . < Bullock >  and < steer >  are also adult castrated males , but bullock is more closely related in meaning to ox in that bullock also suggests a draft animal , while steers are raised for their beef and hides . When one refers to beef cattle in general , it is acceptable to refer to males , females , and young animals as steers . A <bull>  is an adult uncastrated male animal kept usually for breeding purposes only . In Spain and elsewhere , special strains of cattle are bred to provide bulls for the ring . < Cow >  and < heifer >  denote female bovines . The cow is the mature female of any variety of cattle , but the noun calls to mind the familiar animal kept as a milk producer on dairy farms . Heifer is a young cow , especially one less than three years old that has not yet produced young or given milk . < Calf >  is the newborn or very young offspring of the cow , and the term applies to either sex . Bull , cow , and calf are also used to denote the male , female , and young of a number of unrelated animals , as elephants , whales , moose , walruses , and alligators . With various implications , ox , bull , cow , calf , and sometimes heifer are applied figuratively to human beings . Ox suggests slowness , clumsiness , and slow-wittedness . Bull emphasizes brutish masculine strength and virility . Cow may be applied objectionably to an obese and coarse woman , while heifer may suggest a plump country girl .

More often , however , pale suggests a temporary loss of color because of emotion or sickness . In these cases , it is the change in color that is emphasized . Yet , the change need not be negative . Because of the adjective's association with illness , it can refer more generally to an undesirable weakness or dullness . < Ashen >  is a much more restricted intensification of pale ; it refers mainly to an extreme but possibly temporary loss of facial color and usually points to an abnormal or undesirable state . The adjective can also refer to the grayish dull appearance of something that has been vividly colored . < Cadaverous >  is an even more restricted and more intense substitute for ashen . It refers almost exclusively to a facial or bodily state and indicates a more permanent unhealthy or deathly look . In addition to a pale appearance , cadaverous suggests a wasted or diseased gauntness as well . Although cadaverous compares this kind of look to that of a corpse , cadaverous is used to describe a living person . < Pallid >  and < wan >  are both more formal than the foregoing , and both can sound somewhat archaic or precious . Pallid particularly has been overused as a more genteel or supposedly more elegant substitute for pale . In reference to facial appearance , pallid concentrates on unhealthy states rather than those resulting from temporary emotional seizures . It would sound incorrect or affected to use pallid to describe things that naturally lack color . Pallid is useful , however , as a disapproving word for anything dull , dreary , or unspirited . Here , the adjective's suggestion of pre-ciosity is sometimes consciously brought to bear with critical intent . Wan is more restricted to facial appearance and less open to criticism on the grounds of preciosity ; it emphasizes a loss of vigor , temporary or permanent . < Livid >  has almost lost any usefulness it once may have had by the contradictory meanings it has gathered to itself . Coming from a Latin adjective meaning black and blue , livid can refer clinically to a bruised , discolored skin . Many people , however , would tend to misunderstand livid when used in this way . Parallel to this use , livid can refer to a face flushed or purplish from intense emotion , particularly rage . The connection with rage has become so customary that no change in coloration whatever need be suggested by livid . In contrast to this and to the adjective's suggestion of a flushed or a bluish cast , livid can also indicate a color-less or ashen appearance .

As might be suspected from this , parasite is the vaguer of the two when the reference is to people , and leech the more pejorative .

Excuse may also be used of larger offenses that are not criminal nor of a personal nature . Pardon , forgive , and excuse are all used in polite exchanges to convey regret for having caused inconvenience . In this usage , pardon and forgive tend to sound stilted and sententious and are used less often than excuse . < Condone >  and < overlook >  mean pardon or forgive tacitly by accepting without redress actions and situations that merit censure .

Overlook , a weaker verb than condone , suggests indulgent disregard of minor lapses in behavior . < Remit >,  once a close synonym of pardon , is the most formal of all these verbs and its use is limited to ecclesiastical and legal contexts .", "questionList": [{"question": "The governor {_?_} three men and a woman who had been unjustly convicted .", "options": ["forgave", "pardoned", "excused", "remitted", "overlooked", "condoned"], "answer": "pardoned"}, {"question": "A wife may {_?_} an unfaithful husband", "options": ["forgive", "pardon", "excuse", "remit", "overlook", "condone"], "answer": "forgive"}, {"question": "A saint always {_?_} his enemies .", "options": ["forgives", "pardons", "excuses", "remits", "overlooks", "condones"], "answer": "forgives"}, {"question": "We {_?_} her brusqueness because we knew she was under severe strain .", "options": ["forgave", "pardoned", "excused", "remitted", "overlooked", "condoned"], "answer": "excused"}, {"question": "The company {_?_} the guard for falling asleep while on duty .", "options": ["forgave", "pardoned", "excused", "remitted", "overlooked", "condoned"], "answer": "excused"}, {"question": "to {_?_} oneself for jostling a fellow passenger on a bus .", "options": ["forgive", "pardon", "excuse", "remit", "overlook", "condone"], "answer": "excuse"}, {"question": "Child labor is still {_?_} in some states by officials who consider themselves upright and conscientious .", "options": ["forgiven", "pardoned", "excused", "remitted", "overlooked", "condoned"], "answer": "condoned"}, {"question": "A man who cheats on his income tax and on his expense account tends to {_?_} these practices in his friends .", "options": ["forgive", "pardon", "excuse", "remit", "overlook", "condone"], "answer": "condone"}, {"question": "to {_?_} a child's sloppy table manners ; to ____ a bright student's occasional failure to complete an assignment on time .", "options": ["forgive", "pardon", "excuse", "remit", "overlook", "condone"], "answer": "overlook"}, {"question": "to ____ a child's sloppy table manners ; to {_?_} a bright student's occasional failure to complete an assignment on time .", "options": ["forgive", "pardon", "excuse", "remit", "overlook", "condone"], "answer": "overlook"}, {"question": "to {_?_} sins ; to ____ a fine for disturbing the peace .", "options": ["forgive", "pardon", "excuse", "remit", "overlook", "condone"], "answer": "remit"}, {"question": "to ____ sins ; to {_?_} a fine for disturbing the peace .", "options": ["forgive", "pardon", "excuse", "remit", "overlook", "condone"], "answer": "remit"}]}, {"wordSetString": "section,passage,segment,part,portion,piece,subdivision", "original_discussion": "These nouns refer to something looked at as an entity in isolation from the whole of which it is a member . < Part >  is the most general of these , referring to a quantity , sometimes amorphous or unspecified , of a particular whole .

Impassioned is more inward and passive and less ambiguous than passionate when applied to people , suggesting a deep and abiding feeling . Passionate is less lofty in tone and suggests that the desire is more a matter of appetite . Passionate may even suggest a lack of discrimination . It may , of course , be used without suggesting such negative connotations . When applied to the effective expression of strong feeling , impassioned is the more usual choice . < Ardent >, < fiery >,  and < burning >  describe intense feeling in terms of fire . Of these , only ardent is free of negative implications in describing both desire and dedication . Fiery would not be useful to describe states of desire , except for poetic effect , in which case it might be seen as a cliche . In describing dedication , it suggests angry rather than impassioned conviction , and even wildness or instability . Burning , for both desire and dedication , has become a cliche , avoided by thoughtful writers . < Fervent >  and < fervid >  come from the same root , meaning boil . Their relationship is somewhat like that of impassioned and passionate . Fervent , like impassioned , implies being filled with abiding feeling ; fervid , an intensification offervent , suggests feverish intensity and a greater compulsion to act , with the same overtones possible as for passionate . Both fervent and especially fervid , however , have become somewhat stilted in tone . < Zealous >  and < vehement >  are both more applicable to dedication than to desire . One might perhaps speak of a zealous lover , but hardly of a vehement one . Zealous refers most strictly to intense religious conviction , although it applies as well to unwavering adherence to any set of beliefs or attitudes . Zealous suggests that one is prepared to act on one's beliefs without question . This gives a strong negative overtone of fanaticism .

It stresses circumstances in which a sufferer is reduced to helplessness . The adjective usually implies that an innocent victim has unjustly or unfairly been harmed through no fault of his or her own . < Pitiful >  may be used exactly like pathetic , but pitiful has a wider range of uses beyond this context . It can , for example , be used even when the victims may have contributed to their own plights or are entirely responsible for their situations . It may also be used of persons who may not see themselves as victimized in any way and who , in fact , may seem more fortunate than others . < Poignant >  and < touching >  are closely related and both depart from the situation of victimization or misfortune to indicate anything that arouses tender compassion or empathy . Touching is the more informal of the two , suggesting a winning appeal or inevitably affecting scene . Touching most commonly suggests an audience that is actually affected by a scene , whereas pathetic and pitiful may imply no audience at all or one that is hardhearted . This same distinction holds for poignant , which emphasizes the arousal of a bittersweet responsiveness that combines pity and longing or other contradictory emotions . Poignant once emphasized the presence of any sort of keen feelings , but it now points more often to an ambivalence inherent in subtle or gentle shades of compassion , wistfulness , or nostalgia . < Moving >  functions more like touching and poignant than pathetic and pitiful , but it suggests the arousal of emotions stronger than those indicated by the other adjectives . Moving applies to compassion and empathy but also to a wide range of emotions beyond them . Except when applied to a work of art , moving often suggests an arousal to action . < Pitiable >  is unique among these adjectives in stressing that someone is deserving of pity whether or not this condition is noticed by others -- or even detectable by them .", "questionList": [{"question": "the {_?_} struggle of the fawn to free itself from the steel jaws of the trap ;

Most often it refers to a willingness to wait without becoming disgruntled or anxious . More generally , the noun can suggest a kindly tolerance for other people's short-comings , including an ability to remain unperturbed when facing someone else's slowness or other quirks . Where patience implies little difficulty in putting up with annoying situations , < forbearance >  indicates a determined struggle against giving in to negative feelings . Thus , the stress of forbearance is on self-controlled abstinence from hasty or ill-tempered action , whatever the provocation . In this sense , forbearance is positive in tone , more strongly so than the blandness of patience and its implications of passivity . Rut forbearance can refer less positively to an attitude that is disposed to endure annoyance or actual harm . < Sufferance >  and < long-suffering >  both suggest the passive endurance of pain or wretchedness , and so emphasize passive submission . This attitude can as easily be presented as a positive virtue or as a failure of nerve . Of the two , sufferance suggests a more conscious choice in indicating the ability , possibly learned , to endure pain or evil that might destroy someone else . More often , however , sufferance may suggest a generous tolerance for the foibles of others -- or an immoral or permissive failure to take a stand in the face of evil . Long-suffering is more informal and less wide-ranging , referring to the patience with which injuries or misfortunes are endured , especially over a great period of time . long-suffering can also be negative when it suggests a person who glories in unhappiness instead of attempting to alter the situation . < Stoicism >  and < resignation >  refer to a more profound and abiding general life-view than the previous nouns . Stoicism most specifically names the philosophy originated by Zeno , who advised us to be superior to all life's passions -- joy , grief , pleasure , pain . In general use , stoicism is taken , however , to refer mainly to the ability to endure pain . Unlike long-suffering , even the popular sense of stoicism emphatically stresses the enduring of pain without complaint or comment of any sort and usually with complete equanimity . Only in ethical or philosophical discussion can stoicism take on a critical tone , suggesting a sterile attitude in which evil is accepted as inevitable rather than actively opposed . Resignation is much more likely than stoicism to be ambiguous in tone . In pointing to unresisting acquiescence and surrender to the inevitable , especially to misfortune , resignation can suggest a noble or dignified response to tragedy -- or a craven acceptance of a degrading situation . Resignation , like patience , also can be less charged when force or compulsion is present . < Masochism >  is related to the other nouns here in that it refers to the enduring of pain , but it is in sharp contrast to them by indicating a neurotic willingness to suffer or even the conscious or unconscious seeking out of painful experiences . The noun is drawn from psychiatric terminology , where it is sometimes compounded with its opposite in the term sadomasochism because of the intimate connection between the neurotic pleasures of inflicting and suffering pain . But masochism is used widely outside the clinical context for any tendency toward assuming a martyr's role , enjoying one's own miseries , or exposing oneself to needless pain .", "questionList": [{"question": "showing great {_?_} while waiting to leam the outcome of the election .", "options": ["forbearance", "resignation", "masochism", "long-suffering", "sufferance", "patience", "stoicism"], "answer": "patience"}, {"question": "the {_?_} with which she went over the lesson until the slowest student in the class could understand it ; responding with a kind of blank ____ to her com-panion's tumultuous comings and goings .", "options": ["forbearance", "resignation", "masochism", "long-suffering", "sufferance", "patience", "stoicism"], "answer": "patience"}, {"question": "the ____ with which she went over the lesson until the slowest student in the class could understand it ; responding with a kind of blank {_?_} to her com-panion's tumultuous comings and goings .", "options": ["forbearance", "resignation", "masochism", "long-suffering", "sufferance", "patience", "stoicism"], "answer": "patience"}, {"question": "answering with such {_?_} that only his flushed face showed how angry he really was .", "options": ["forbearance", "resignation", "masochism", "long-suffering", "sufferance", "patience", "stoicism"], "answer": "forbearance"}, {"question": "minority groups no longer willing to meet indignities with mealy-mouthed {_?_} .", "options": ["forbearance", "resignation", "masochism", "long-suffering", "sufferance", "patience", "stoicism"], "answer": "forbearance"}, {"question": "their {_?_} of the scapegoat's role through centuries of maltreatment .", "options": ["forbearance", "resignation", "masochism", "long-suffering", "sufferance", "patience", "stoicism"], "answer": "sufferance"}, {"question": "pragmatic in her good-humored {_?_} of student pranks ; the average citizen's apathetic ____ of the regime's repressive laws .", "options": ["forbearance", "resignation", "masochism", "long-suffering", "sufferance", "patience", "stoicism"], "answer": "sufferance"}, {"question": "pragmatic in her good-humored ____ of student pranks ; the average citizen's apathetic {_?_} of the regime's repressive laws .", "options": ["forbearance", "resignation", "masochism", "long-suffering", "sufferance", "patience", "stoicism"], "answer": "sufferance"}, {"question": "facing his wife's invalidism with hard-bitten grimness and {_?_} .", "options": ["forbearance", "resignation", "masochism", "long-suffering", "sufferance", "patience", "stoicism"], "answer": "long-suffering"}, {"question": "the tedious display of {_?_} with which she recounted every cruelty imposed by her husband .", "options": ["forbearance", "resignation", "masochism", "long-suffering", "sufferance", "patience", "stoicism"], "answer": "long-suffering"}, {"question": "the {_?_} of the few who can be tortured to death without once crying out for mercy .", "options": ["forbearance", "resignation", "masochism", "long-suffering", "sufferance", "patience", "stoicism"], "answer": "stoicism"}, {"question": "an invidious {_?_} that allowed otherwise decent citizens to tolerate affronts to their self-respect .", "options": ["forbearance", "resignation", "masochism", "long-suffering", "sufferance", "patience", "stoicism"], "answer": "stoicism"}, {"question": "the stark {_?_} with which she stood beside her husband's coffin ; railing at the ____ with which most voters viewed the corrupt political machine that ran the city .", "options": ["forbearance", "resignation", "masochism", "long-suffering", "sufferance", "patience", "stoicism"], "answer": "resignation"}, {"question": "the stark ____ with which she stood beside her husband's coffin ; railing at the {_?_} with which most voters viewed the corrupt political machine that ran the city .", "options": ["forbearance", "resignation", "masochism", "long-suffering", "sufferance", "patience", "stoicism"], "answer": "resignation"}, {"question": "hopeless {_?_} to his fate after twenty years of incarceration .", "options": ["forbearance", "resignation", "masochism", "long-suffering", "sufferance", "patience", "stoicism"], "answer": "resignation"}, {"question": "the {_?_} inherent in drug addiction .", "options": ["forbearance", "resignation", "masochism", "long-suffering", "sufferance", "patience", "stoicism"], "answer": "masochism"}, {"question": "Only a streak of {_?_} in her could have allowed her to stay married to such a brutal man .", "options": ["forbearance", "resignation", "masochism", "long-suffering", "sufferance", "patience", "stoicism"], "answer": "masochism"}]}, {"wordSetString": "palaver,patter,chitchat,small talk", "original_discussion": "These nouns refer to glib or trivial discussion or conversation . < Patter >  and < palaver >  are the most general . Patter emphasizes rapidity and insincerity of speech , whereas palaver stresses a lack of content or an intent to flatter or deceive . Patter can indicate mechanical recitation , reflecting its derivation from a reference to the hasty saying of the Paternoster ; it can also refer to rehearsed comedy routines , or to bodies of dialect or jargon . Drawing from this range of use , patter in its conversational context adds to its emphasis on rapidity the connotations of rehearsed or at least predictable conversational patterns . A note of condescension is usually present . Palaver is also condescending , suggesting exchanges devoid of substance . Palaver can refer to a public discussion or conference , reflecting its original reference to a parley between indigenous persons and an explorer or missionary , in which condescension is clear . More often , however , palaver can refer to an informal group discussion , possibly assembled in haste to decide on a course of action . It can also refer to the disorganized uproar of voices from any group . In either case , palaver has a distinctly informal tone . < Chitchat >  and < small talk >  are both restricted to idle conversation . Chitchat , the most informal of all the nouns considered here , combines the predictability suggested by patter with the lack of substance indicated by palaver . In contrast to patter , however , chitchat may point to a slow pace and , unlike palaver , does not suggest group discussion so much as a random exchange of banalities or gossip . The phrase small talk also refers to trivial talk but suggests as well that such conversation may be the result of choice or inhibition and may serve as an icebreaker or as prelude to more interesting matter .", "questionList": [{"question": "the conventional {_?_} exchanged at faculty parties ; tedious ____ about the weather and high cost of living .", "options": ["palaver", "patter", "chitchat", "small talk"], "answer": "patter"}, {"question": "the conventional ____ exchanged at faculty parties ; tedious {_?_} about the weather and high cost of living .", "options": ["palaver", "patter", "chitchat", "small talk"], "answer": "patter"}, {"question": "the {_?_} of neighbors gathered in front of the house from which the strange sounds were coming .", "options": ["palaver", "patter", "chitchat", "small talk"], "answer": "palaver"}, {"question": "a general {_?_} that did not die down until the conductor interrupted the concert .", "options": ["palaver", "patter", "chitchat", "small talk"], "answer": "palaver"}, {"question": "the kind of {_?_} that was a sure sign the cocktail party was dying on its feet .", "options": ["palaver", "patter", "chitchat", "small talk"], "answer": "chitchat"}, {"question": "waiting for the {_?_} to give way to a real discussion of the issues confronting the group ; planning bits of ____ with which to become part of interesting conversations she heard at the party .", "options": ["palaver", "patter", "chitchat", "small talk"], "answer": "small talk"}, {"question": "waiting for the ____ to give way to a real discussion of the issues confronting the group ; planning bits of {_?_} with which to become part of interesting conversations she heard at the party .", "options": ["palaver", "patter", "chitchat", "small talk"], "answer": "small talk"}]}, {"wordSetString": "destitute,necessitous,poverty-stricken,indigent,penniless,needy", "original_discussion": "These adjectives describe people who are poor , who do not have enough money to maintain a decent standard of living , or who have lost their means of subsistence . < Penniless >  usually refers to someone who has undergone a sudden , calamitous loss of money and property but may not be in real want . Penniless may also be applied to those who make no real attempt to be economically stable , or who are unequipped to do so . < Poverty-stricken >  is the most comprehensive term and may be substituted for any of the other adjectives in this group . It is generally used , however , to describe people who lack the resources to make life even passably comfortable , either through economic stress or because , as in the case of members of some religious orders , they have chosen a way of life in which they must forgo many necessities and all luxuries . Poverty-stricken points to a condition that is more or less hopeless and permanent , or at least tends to go on for a long period . Poverty-stricken is used also to describe conditions and situations that exhibit or even cause poverty . < Destitute >  emphasizes poverty of such severity that one is deprived of such necessities as food , clothing , and shelter . < Indigent >  indicates a state of less dire want than do poverty-stricken and destitute , and it is sometimes used in opposition to affluent . Indigent is applied to those suffering from what used to be known as genteel poverty , in which circumstances are straitened but something of the former outward facade is preserved . A <needy>  person is one who is certainly poverty-stricken or even destitute , but needy implies an inability to maintain oneself without some help from public or private assistance . < Necessitous >  is a close synonym of poverty-stricken and needy , but it now tends to sound literary and is infrequently used .", "questionList": [{"question": "At the time of the stock-market crash in 1929 , many wealthy people found themselves {_?_}", "options": ["destitute", "necessitous", "poverty-stricken", "indigent", "penniless", "needy"], "answer": "penniless"}, {"question": "John's father left his family {_?_} .", "options": ["destitute", "necessitous", "poverty-stricken", "indigent", "penniless", "needy"], "answer": "penniless"}, {"question": "{_?_} panhandlers on every street comer ; a ____ artist who devoted all her energies to her painting .", "options": ["destitute", "necessitous", "poverty-stricken", "indigent", "penniless", "needy"], "answer": "penniless"}, {"question": "____ panhandlers on every street comer ; a {_?_} artist who devoted all her energies to her painting .", "options": ["destitute", "necessitous", "poverty-stricken", "indigent", "penniless", "needy"], "answer": "penniless"}, {"question": "{_?_} tenant farmers who never realized any cash from their crops .", "options": ["destitute", "necessitous", "poverty-stricken", "indigent", "penniless", "needy"], "answer": "poverty-stricken"}, {"question": "a {_?_} country with little industry ; the ____ homes of Native Americans on some reservations .", "options": ["destitute", "necessitous", "poverty-stricken", "indigent", "penniless", "needy"], "answer": "poverty-stricken"}, {"question": "a ____ country with little industry ; the {_?_} homes of Native Americans on some reservations .", "options": ["destitute", "necessitous", "poverty-stricken", "indigent", "penniless", "needy"], "answer": "poverty-stricken"}, {"question": "a {_?_} slum family evicted for not paying rent ; ____ , lost children wandering about in a bombed-out city .", "options": ["destitute", "necessitous", "poverty-stricken", "indigent", "penniless", "needy"], "answer": "destitute"}, {"question": "a ____ slum family evicted for not paying rent ; {_?_} , lost children wandering about in a bombed-out city .", "options": ["destitute", "necessitous", "poverty-stricken", "indigent", "penniless", "needy"], "answer": "destitute"}, {"question": "The {_?_} old couple , who find it hard to make ends meet on a pension , manage to keep their home neat and tidy .", "options": ["destitute", "necessitous", "poverty-stricken", "indigent", "penniless", "needy"], "answer": "indigent"}, {"question": "Christmas dinners provided for the homeless and {_?_} ; ____ children who receive free health care at the clinic .", "options": ["destitute", "necessitous", "poverty-stricken", "indigent", "penniless", "needy"], "answer": "needy"}, {"question": "Christmas dinners provided for the homeless and ____ ; {_?_} children who receive free health care at the clinic .", "options": ["destitute", "necessitous", "poverty-stricken", "indigent", "penniless", "needy"], "answer": "needy"}]}, {"wordSetString": "hoi polloi,masses,rabble,populace,people,herd,mob", "original_discussion": "These nouns refer to the citizens of a country or a region when considered collectively . < People >,  the most general , is usually neutral in implication ; it can be used simply as the plural of person , as a reference to all the inhabitants of a given place , as a reference to public opinion , or as a way to distinguish between a group and its leaders . < Populace >  is even more consistently neutral than people and is more restricted in meaning , referring almost exclusively to the inhabitants of a given place . It is often used in statistical accounts and has consequently gained a technical flavor . Populace , however , comes from an Italian pejorative and is sometimes used in this older way . All the rest of these nouns , with varying degrees of intensity , provide pejorative ways of referring to common people or the lower classes , attributing to them vulgarity , ignorance , or gullibility and implying in the user of these nouns a conscious or unconscious snobbery . < Masses >  and the phrase < hoi polloi >  are the least pejorative of these , for differing reasons . Masses specifically suggests the lower classes . Leftist political thinkers , however , have sometimes used masses in a positive or outraged sense that blunts the noun's pejorative force . Hoi polloi refers more to the ordinary citizen than to class stratification . Careful writers remember that hoi is the Greek definite article . An extraneous article is frequently added by less careful writers . < Mob >  in this context implies that the general public can be considered an ignorant unity joined together by fear and anger , one easily swayed by demagogic special pleading . < Herd >  is more negative than mob and stresses conformity , a gullible willingness to be led , or frantic but meaningless activity . < Rabble >  is the most pejorative of all these nouns ; it suggests a disorganized , poverty-stricken group of ignorant people . When it is applied widely to groups of people , it expresses contempt for democratic ideals .

But there are differences between descry and espy that should make their usage more precise . Descry suggests careful observation of the distant or obscure , and there is more impheation of effort and attention in descry than in espy , which hints at a chance , sudden , or unexpected discovery . Descry also refers to the kind of discovery that is the property of the mind and not the eyes . In this sense , descry means understand or come to realize by examination and investigation .

It may refer to negative attributes as well as positive , in this case stressing total badness . < Flawless >  relates closely to the aspect of perfect that emphasizes lack of blemish .

Because of this , it is not used to indicate total badness , since it would make no sense to refer to a flawless fool . Furthermore , something can be flawless and yet far from perfect . < Consummate >  is closely related to perfect in its sense of ultimate completeness . Here it gives an overtone of slow maturation through disciplined effort .

It suggests the greatest excellence one can imagine . If used to describe something that exists , the resulting hyperbole invites disbelief .

Perform also differs from do in stressing the idea of a ritual or a formal public presentation . It implies the rendering of a work or the carrying out of a rite that already exists , while do may suggest spontaneity and improvisation . In another comparison , to do a play is to undertake it and prepare it for presentation . To perform a play is to give it before an audience . Perform can also mean discharge an obligation , duty , or command . In this sense , it is close to < fulfill >,  which stresses accomplishment of something pledged , hoped for , or anticipated . Of all these verbs , fulfill puts the greatest stress on completion or consummation , the realization of potential or capabilities . Hence it implies an ultimate performance . < Conduct >  is close to perform but stresses direction , leadership , or supervision . With reference to music , it is used of a single person and means direct the performance of a work . < Execute >  is like perform in several senses . Execute can suggest intricacy , meaning perform something demanding expert skill or faultless technique . Or it can point to accomplishment , meaning follow , carry out , or put into effect .

By extension , it can refer to the bounding line of any curved shape , plane or solid . < Girth >  refers specifically to the circumference of a curved solid , particularly the waist or belly of a person or animal .", "questionList": [{"question": "They posted No Trespass signs along the {_?_} of the estate ; the ins and outs of fjords that add hundreds of miles to the ____ of the Norwegian coastline .", "options": ["periphery", "circumference", "perimeter", "girth"], "answer": "perimeter"}, {"question": "They posted No Trespass signs along the ____ of the estate ; the ins and outs of fjords that add hundreds of miles to the {_?_} of the Norwegian coastline .", "options": ["periphery", "circumference", "perimeter", "girth"], "answer": "perimeter"}, {"question": "the shifting {_?_} of each task force in the battle zone .", "options": ["peripheries", "circumferences", "perimeters", "girths"], "answer": "perimeters"}, {"question": "a planet on the {_?_} of the solar system ; less familiar with the paths that ran along the ____ of the camping areas .", "options": ["periphery", "circumference", "perimeter", "girth"], "answer": "periphery"}, {"question": "a planet on the ____ of the solar system ; less familiar with the paths that ran along the {_?_} of the camping areas .", "options": ["periphery", "circumference", "perimeter", "girth"], "answer": "periphery"}, {"question": "an official position that was on the {_?_} of the adminis-tration's center of power .", "options": ["periphery", "circumference", "perimeter", "girth"], "answer": "periphery"}, {"question": "a hundred seats along the outside {_?_} of the amphitheater ; a barrel four feet at its widest ____ .", "options": ["periphery", "circumference", "perimeter", "girth"], "answer": "circumference"}, {"question": "a hundred seats along the outside ____ of the amphitheater ; a barrel four feet at its widest {_?_} .", "options": ["periphery", "circumference", "perimeter", "girth"], "answer": "circumference"}, {"question": "the {_?_} of a redwood at its base ; a strap too short for the ____ of the horse ; a fat man of astonishing ____ .", "options": ["periphery", "circumference", "perimeter", "girth"], "answer": "girth"}, {"question": "the ____ of a redwood at its base ; a strap too short for the {_?_} of the horse ; a fat man of astonishing ____ .", "options": ["periphery", "circumference", "perimeter", "girth"], "answer": "girth"}, {"question": "the ____ of a redwood at its base ; a strap too short for the ____ of the horse ; a fat man of astonishing {_?_} .", "options": ["periphery", "circumference", "perimeter", "girth"], "answer": "girth"}]}, {"wordSetString": "eon,era,generation,age,epoch,cycle,period", "original_discussion": "These nouns can serve as arbitrary labels given to sequences of time . < Period >  is the most general of these , and < eon >  the least definite . Period can describe any passage of time , great or small . In reference to history , period can loosely characterize a sequence of time as a convenient aid to discussion , without claiming that such a sequence is homogeneous or self-contained . By contrast , eon is used , often in the plural , to indicate an immeasurably long stretch of time . While otherwise vague in reference , eon explicitly rejects any notion of uniformity in the period alluded to . < Cycle >  is much more clear-cut at its most restricted , referring to a single and complete instance in a recurring pattern of time . Sometimes , cycle can refer to the recurring pattern itself . < Epoch >  most strictly indicates an event of such significance that it can be said to usher in a new period in history . More often now , epoch is used to refer indefinitely to a compact or self-contained period in human history , recognizable because of a consistency in its emphases or concerns . < Era >  refers exclusively to such a self-contained period of history , although the time span implied may be longer than that suggested by the extended use of epoch . < Generation >  refers to the period between the birth of parents and the birth of their offspring , sometimes calculated for human beings as twenty or twenty-five years ; it may also refer to the offspring themselves . More pertinent here , generation has become a fad word for typifying any era , often shorter than twenty years , in which young people coming of age seem involved in concerns or behavior more characteristic of them than of their parents . < Age >  might often suggest a longer period than epoch or era , one that could be typified in terms of some dominant interest or person . Some writers feel that age is preferable to era in such designations , since the former is factual in tone , whereas era can possibly sound pretentious or inflated . In geology , paleontology , and archeology , the terms era , period , epoch , and age have been assigned arbitrary definitions . In paleontology , the paleozoic era is divided into the age of invertebrates , the age of fishes , and the age of amphibians . In geology , the paleozoic era is divided into periods , such as the Permian Period , which is further subdivided into epochs , such as the Thuringian Epoch . In archeology , the basic division is an age , determined by the predominant culture , as the Stone Age , the Bronze Age , and the Iron Age .

It refers chiefly to an activity that is not susceptible to interruption . In everyday talk perpetual is used of things that are annoying or seem to continue for maddeningly long periods of time . < Durable >,  less closely related to the above adjectives , describes that which is able to continue for a long time in the same state and has the power to resist change , decay , and wear . < Perennial >  differs from the other adjectives in that it originally stipulated a set period of time -- a year .

It emphasizes both entry and diffusion , indicating infiltration through pores . It may be used in a physical sense . Or it may apply to a sense impression . It is especially expressive , however , in figurative contexts with reference to intangibles . < Penetrate >  comes from a Latin verb meaning put within . More strongly than permeate , penetrate stresses the initial entry into something and usually implies the overcoming of resistance . Penetrate is also used of a figurative breakthrough and may sometimes refer to a deep or lasting effect made on the mind or emotions . < Pervade >  comes from Latin roots meaning go through and marks a shift in emphasis from entry to effect . Where permeate refers to an action like that of a gas that diffuses through all the pores or intermolecular spaces of a solid or another gas , pervade describes the action of a gas that fills all the open space of a chamber . Hence , a gas pervades a room by permeating the air in the room . In extended senses , pervade is more closely synonymous with permeate ; it may be used of any quality , idea , force , influence , or sensation diffused throughout all of a thing . < Impregnate >  goes beyond permeate and pervade . It stresses the new qualities or characteristics gained by a substance through which some other substance has been diffused . It is also used figuratively . < Saturate >  comes from a Latin verb meaning fill up , and < supersaturate >  is an intensification of saturate . In chemistry , a solution is said to be saturated when the solvent can hold no more of the solute under existing conditions of temperature and pressure . A supersaturated solution is one carried beyond the normal degree of saturation , made to hold more solute by a mechanical process of heating and cooling . A slight shock or the addition of one more bit of solute to such a solution can suddenly produce crystallization . When air becomes saturated with water vapor , having a relative humidity of 100% , the excess vapor begins to condense as dew ; when supersaturated , the air contains an amount of moisture more than sufficient to saturate it , as in a fog . In general usage , saturate means fill anything to the utmost extent of its capacity for absorbing or retaining . Going well beyond permeate , it often suggests a thorough soaking or a being thoroughly soaked . Saturate is also used figuratively . Supersaturate also has extended uses , referring to more of anything than can be absorbed or accommodated . < Imbue >  comes from a Latin verb meaning wet , soak , or dye . In a physical sense , it suggests the imparting of a color that soaks in and saturates the whole . In a figurative sense , imbue means fill or impregnate , as with emotions , ideals , or other intangible qualities .", "questionList": [{"question": "a waterproof fabric , treated with a substance that keeps water from {_?_} it ;

As a transitive verb , it suggests the same dauntless struggle for existence against odds that persist can refer to , but without overtones of obstinacy , since endure is almost wholly favorable in tone . Intransitively , < survive >  indicates continued existence . Often , survive implies the successful overcoming of an ordeal or threat to existence . Transitively , survive compares with endure , except that the latter suggests a strength and permanence that can overcome obstacles intact , whereas survive is open to the implication of greater frailty or subsequent impairment . < Weather >  is restricted to a transitive sense that points to the surviving of crises or exposures to danger . Weather may apply to lasting out difficulty without change or impairment , but more often it suggests an altered state , though this may often be one of increased maturity or mellowness .", "questionList": [{"question": "A dwindling hope of restoring the monarchy {_?_} for a century .", "options": ["lasted", "survived", "continued", "endured", "weathered", "persisted"], "answer": "persisted"}, {"question": "a species that {_?_} despite the depredations of floods , glaciers , famine , and plague .", "options": ["lasted", "survived", "continued", "endured", "weathered", "persisted"], "answer": "persisted"}, {"question": "He {_?_} in quibbling about fine points in the contract long after everyone else was satisfied", "options": ["lasted", "survived", "continued", "endured", "weathered", "persisted"], "answer": "persisted"}, {"question": "Why do you still {_?_} in bothering us with demands for money ?", "options": ["last", "survive", "continue", "endure", "weather", "persist"], "answer": "persist"}, {"question": "an announcement that the bombings would {_?_} ;

It can refer to the matter and energy of the universe and the science that treats it . Anything apparent to the senses can be described by physical . It can also refer to the body . Or it can distinguish the body from the mind . In dualistic philosophy , physical contrasts with spiritual . Most concretely , if somewhat euphemistically , physical can refer to sexuality . < Corporeal >  more clearly contrasts with the spiritual or immaterial than physical .

Beyond this stock phrase , corporal is less often used than the more direct < bodily >,  The latter can be neutral in itself , or it can be opposed to the mental or spiritual . Related to the last possibility , bodily can refer specifically to sensual or sexual pleasures , possibly in a disapproving way , although this use may now sound old-fashioned . < Fleshly >  and < carnal >  concentrate on this last implication of bodily , fleshly appearing in a religious context and carnal most often in legal terminology .

Actually , an earlier use of pollute referred directly to any defiling of sanctity or of physical or moral purity . < Contaminate >  refers to the spreading of harmful or undesirable impurities through something previously free of taint . The resulting impurity may be negligible or , as is the case for pollute , thoroughgoing and widespread . In addition , where pollute often indicates readily apparent or grossly visible impurities , contaminate is often the word of choice where the change is slow , devious , unsuspected , or not noticeable by ordinary means . In other uses , contaminate is milder than pollute in that it can sometimes suggest a temporary tinge rather than an irrevocable stain . < Adulterate >  has special relevance to food products to which harmful , low-quality , or low-cost substances have been deliberately and deceptively added in order to defraud the buyer . Theoretically , adulterate can apply to other products debased by additives , even where there is no intent to defraud , but such uses are rare . In its widest applications , adulterate can apply to any mixture of good and bad where the bad seems deliberately included by the producer in the hope that it will go unnoticed . The remaining verbs apply more generally than the foregoing and do not have specific applications to a concrete situation . < Pervert >  indicates misdirecting something , leading it astray , or turning it in a wrong direction , as away from the good , pure , and moral , and toward what is considered depraved or evil . As can be seen , pervert suggests a grotesque or hideous transformation ; this makes it even more emphatic than pollute in comparable uses , although here complete alteration is indicated , rather than the inclusion of additives . A specific sense of pervert once referred to something that caused sexual deviation , but this use is more and more avoided because of its judgmental tone . < Vitiate >  is the most general verb here , having no area of concrete reference . It applies widely to whatever can be seen as nullifying the value of something . Vitiate sometimes is used only for impairment rather than complete destruction .

This can be a husband with more than one wife , a wife with more than one husband , or a group marriage in which two or more husbands are married to two or more wives . Outside an anthropological context , polygamy is often understood to refer directly to the situation of a husband with two or more wives , since this departure from monogamy has been more widely dealt with ( and perhaps practiced ) than other departures . < Polygyny >  would be the strict anthropological term for the situation in which two or more wives are married to one husband . By contrast , < polyandry >  points specifically to the marrying of two or more husbands to one wife . < Trigamy >,  an infrequently encountered term , refers to the state of having three wives or three husbands at the same time , or to the state of having been married to three wives or three husbands at different times . < Bigamy >  refers as a legal term in Western civilization to the crime of being married to more than one spouse at the same time ; bigamy functions for either sex . At first it might seem that the term is a legal substitute for the word polygamy , but one can be guilty of bigamy without practicing polygamy , through discarding one spouse without a legal divorce and marrying another while claiming to be unmarried . Bigamy usually suggests a situation in which there is deception of at least one of the spouses , since few people in a monogamous society consent presumably to marrying someone already married .

Underprivileged is vaguely and categorically applied to those who , because of economic oppression and illiteracy , are deprived of many of the basic necessities that most people take for granted . Disadvantaged is more specific than underprivileged and stresses the need for granting full civil rights and effective schooling to the young who are the victims of poverty and racial discrimination . Disadvantaged also suggests the psychological damage that poor children may suffer . < Hard up >  is an informal phrase for poor .

As in the last example , it is commonly used to refer to the activities of professional pollsters . Like predict , < forecast >  can range in use from the general or vague to the specific , but in this case its most specific use -- for predicting weather -- has crowded out other uses of forecast . < Divine >  and < foreshadow >  both concern suggesting rather than predicting the future , especially through the giving or assessing of subtle hints or clues . Divine implies the action of someone capable of reading present evidence in all its ambiguity and seeing where it must lead . Divine originally suggested powers of clairvoyance , but it is now seldom used in this sense . Foreshadow , unlike divine , does not necessarily imply a shrewd reading of clues ; it can refer to anyone or anything that gives an indication of what is to come . Foreshadow is often used to refer to the hinting by a storyteller of what will happen eventually in a story . Like divine , < augur >, < prophesy >,  and even < foretell >  once suggested a supernatural ability to read the future . Now these verbs have mainly lost this use , although they still suggest , unlike predict and forecast , a future that is already set and determined rather than one that can be rationally assumed from the evidence at hand . Of these three , augur is most like divine in implying a reading of subtle omens and clues as a way of prefiguring what is to come . Like foreshadow , augur can also refer to the sign or clue itself . Prophesy sounds more portentous than augur , suggesting authoritative wisdom and acumen . Both augur and prophesy are sometimes used in place of predict and forecast to give a higher tone or to suggest unerring accuracy ; many would find the uses questionable . Foretell now has fewer residual implications of the supernatural than augur and prophesy , as well as being far less formal . It would , however , still sound odd as a substitute for predict or forecast . Like foreshadow , foretell can refer to the clue rather than to its practitioner . It is often used negatively in referring to the past . < Prognosticate >  comes from a different context altogether from the verbs just discussed . It suggests a knowledgeable look at the symptoms of a disease in order to determine its likely outcome .

Most , but not all of them , partake of the prophetic , and some directly involve superstition . A <premonition>  is instinctive , based on an indefinable feeling rather than on actual information received . It may be good or bad , may come in sleep or wakefulness , and may be either borne out or proved false by later events . Some premonitions are purely irrational or superstitious ; others , possible instances of extrasensory perception . < Presentiment >  is close to premonition in meaning but is more formal in tone . Etymologically , where premonition stresses the idea of an advance warning given to the mind , presentiment points to a sort of inner perception , usually an instinctive feeling of foreboding , a sense that misfortune or calamity is at hand . Like a premonition or presentiment , an < inkling >  is an intimation of something yet unknown . Getting an inkling of something , however , does not require prophetic powers or ESP . Instead , the ability to interpret natural signs , pick up hints , or guess on the basis of a paucity of information is involved . Unlike the other nouns , it is often used negatively in disclaiming or denying knowledge of something . < Omen >  and < portent >  designate outward and visible signs that are regarded as prophetic and are subject to interpretation . Both strongly imply a superstitious response . To those who believe , there are both good and evil omens . A stork nesting on the roof , for example , is considered a good omen . A black cat crossing one's path is thought to be an evil omen . Unlike an omen , which may be favorable , a portent more often , though not always , indicates impending evil . A portent may be a sign , an event , a wonder , a natural or unnatural phenomenon . It may be something to marvel at , as a flaming comet , or it may be something heavy with foreboding , as a total eclipse . Omen and portent , modified by adjectives like black , bad , ill , or evil , may also mean ominous significance . The remaining nouns refer to a messenger or herald who signals the approach of a coming person or thing . Formerly , a < harbinger >  was a courier who rode in advance of a party to arrange for lodging . Now , though harbinger may mean anyone in the vanguard whose job is to prepare the way , it is more often used figuratively of a person or thing that heralds the approach of a change . Unlike the other nouns in this set , < forerunner >  and < precursor >  may indicate hindsight rather than foresight , pointing to an advance sign that is seen as such only in terms of later events . Both nouns have the same etymological meaning , precursor meaning forerunner in Latin , but now differ somewhat in use . Forerunner more strongly retains the original sense of a person who goes ahead as a messenger to proclaim the coming of another . John the Baptist is known as the Forerunner since he heralded the coming of Christ . < Precursor >  was also used of John the Baptist , but where forerunner stresses the announcement of the coming of a more important person , precursor implies a laying of the groundwork for a later , more significant accomplishment . Both forerunner and precursor may refer to a predecessor in a particular line of development , or an advance indication of something to come .

However , the interpolation is unnecessary when reference is made to a volume , outpouring , profusion , cascade , or flow . Copious can also serve as a more formal intensification of abundant , sometimes indicating a superfluity . < Ample >,  in contrast to copious , means both just enough and more than enough , and so tends to imply an amount between enough and plentiful ; ample but not generous servings ; an ample income ; ample room for a family of five . When used of a person , ample can also refer , in a humorous way , to generous or excessive size .", "questionList": [{"question": "ideas {_?_} in the Renaissance ; varieties of wildflowers ____ in the Rockies .", "options": ["rife", "abundant", "prevalent", "ample", "plentiful", "common", "copious", "widespread", "prevailing"], "answer": "prevalent"}, {"question": "ideas ____ in the Renaissance ;

The measures may also be positive steps taken to ward off potential trouble . Prevent is also used of a nonhuman agency or chance cause that acts as a hindrance ; in such cases , only the effect of the agent is stressed and no motive is attributed to it . < Stop >  in this sense is more informal than prevent and has greater immediacy . Where prevent often implies forethought and advance preparation to keep something from occurring , stop focuses on responsive action to the circumstance at hand .

To < preclude >  is to prevent by anticipation or to rule out by necessity . Preclude is used not of persons but of events , circumstances , decisions , or the like . It suggests a door shut in advance , as a consequence of a prior action , occurrence , choice , or commitment . < Forestall >  is like preclude in emphasizing anticipation , but it implies deliberate deterrence . Where preclude points to circumstances that make an occurrence impossible , forestall involves taking preventive countermeasures in time to turn something aside or temper its effect . < Avert >,  more strongly and more specifically than forestall , implies warding off a threat or danger .

At other colleges , particularly in Europe , lecturer may be a rank in itself , and often such a person may actually be a professor . Lecturer may also indicate a person invited to give a single talk or group of talks and thus is a teacher who remains outside the academic hierarchy entirely . Also , some large classes are taught by lecturers and then broken down into smaller discussion groups , taught by instructors . < Don >  indicates a teacher in British and other colleges who is neither a professor nor a lecturer , but who instructs students individually , a technique that forms the basic method of the students' education . Such a faculty member may have or may attain both rank and tenure within such systems .", "questionList": [{"question": "advancing from assistant {_?_} to associate ____ and finally to full ____ in the shortest possible time .", "options": ["professor", "don", "lecturer", "graduate assistant", "instructor"], "answer": "professor"}, {"question": "advancing from assistant ____ to associate {_?_} and finally to full ____ in the shortest possible time .", "options": ["professor", "don", "lecturer", "graduate assistant", "instructor"], "answer": "professor"}, {"question": "advancing from assistant ____ to associate ____ and finally to full {_?_} in the shortest possible time .", "options": ["professor", "don", "lecturer", "graduate assistant", "instructor"], "answer": "professor"}, {"question": "{_?_} to teach the upperclassmen and ____ to teach freshmen .", "options": ["professors", "dons", "lecturers", "instructors", "graduate assistants"], "answer": "professors"}, {"question": "____ to teach the upperclassmen and {_?_} to teach freshmen .", "options": ["professors", "dons", "lecturers", "instructors", "graduate assistants"], "answer": "instructors"}, {"question": "a guest {_?_} invited to give a term of lectures on modem art .", "options": ["professor", "don", "lecturer", "graduate assistant", "instructor"], "answer": "lecturer"}]}, {"wordSetString": "debar,interdict,prohibit,forbid,ban,enjoin", "original_discussion": "These verbs are alike in referring to a declaration that something must not be done or to an action that prevents something from being done .

Project is the more general of the two and can apply equally well to the planned task of a single person or to such a task involving a number of people . Project is often used to refer to the result achieved by such work , long after its planning and completion . Program is more formal and more abstract than project and applies most often to group work . Where project might suggest a single self-contained objective , often requiring physical labor , program can suggest a more complex set of such projects or the application of largely mental or administrative effort . < Activity >  is the most general of these nouns . While it need not suggest a plan or objective , it is often used to refer to the work done on a project or carried out by a group . It stresses the actual carrying out of something that continues without any point of completion . < Operation >  is close to activity in its generality , suggesting continuing motion without necessarily implying the possibility of completion . It has come to have a special use in reference to a complex program designed to achieve a defined goal ; this use , borrowed from the military , follows the capitalized word with a colorful epithet . < Enterprise >  and < undertaking >  are the most formal of these nouns . Enterprise may suggest improvisation toward a less clearly defined goal and may imply an element of risk ; it may also suggest boldness and strenuous endeavor .

The verb is most often used , however , of a mechanical force or a separate source of power ; an explosive that propels a projectile from a gun ; a fuel that serves to propel a missile or a rocket ; a boat propelled by steam or by an outboard motor . < Push >  generally implies physical contact between the mover and the moved . It specifically indicates force or pressure exerted on or against one side of an object to move it forward , in the opposite direction , or out of the way . The force employed may be slight or considerable . Applied to persons , push often implies impatience and consequent rudeness . Push has many other shades of meaning depending on context . < Shove >  is close to push but is generally a stronger word , implying a greater degree of forcible pressure or physical effort . More often than push , shove indicates exertion , as in pushing a heavy object along a surface . Used of persons , it may imply greater belligerence or determination than push , focusing on rough haste or blunt rudeness in pushing insistently . Push and shove are often used in tandem . To < thrust >  is to push suddenly and forcibly , as on impulse or because of some stimulus . Unlike the other verbs here , thrust often implies a putting of one thing into another . It may mean put a person forcibly into some situation . Or it may refer to the act of pushing into something with a sharp or pointed instrument . In an extended sense , thrust can mean have anything forced upon one against one's will . < Press >  and < urge >,  in this context , point to an outward influence that propels one toward a goal . Urge may be used of physical force . More often , however , urge indicates strong persuasion , the psychological exertion of a prompting or impelling influence .

Prototype can also indicate the first full-scale model of something . Less specifically , prototype can also indicate any sort of precursor of a later instance . < Pattern >  can apply to the plans for a product rather than to the prototype or the later creations made from its specifications . It often suggests blueprints or templates to be followed in constructing the product . More generally , pattern indicates the design or configuration that something actually takes . But pattern can also refer to the perfect representative of a type , or to any example thought worthy of emulation . < Original >  is close to prototype in distinguishing the first or genuine product from copies or later versions . < Urtext >,  the most restricted of these nouns , is from German and refers to the earliest version of a musical or literary work , whether written or printed and whether extant or not . < Archetype >  can also refer to the earliest version of a literary work , referring strictly to a manuscript that no longer exists . Archetype refers much more widely , however , to the abstract conception of a perfect type . In Platonism , archetypes are the general or pure forms of which existing things are imperfect copies . Jung initiated a modem redefinition of archetype to refer to those forms and symbols in the unconscious of all people that theoretically reflect the history of the species . More loosely , archetype can refer to the quintessential elements something contains .

However , it usually suggests an imagined perfection , formulated as a goal to strive for or as a measure against which to test something that exists . As can be seen , ideal may indicate a personal rather than universal set of desirable qualities , whereas archetype refers to what is generally and invariably true of all examples , at least in essence .

Pseudonym is the most general term in this group and includes all the others . It does not suggest a discreditable motive for concealing one's identity but may be adopted merely because it is more striking or easier to recall than one's actual name . < Pen name >  and < nom de plume >  ( a term coined in England from French elements ) both refer specifically to a fictitious name an author signs to a book , article , or other literary work . An < alias >  is a name taken to conceal one's identity , often for suspect purposes . An alias is often assumed to avoid the consequences of a criminal record or to confuse law officers . On the other hand , a reformed criminal or a person who has been involved in a scandal may move to another area to make a fresh start and there take an alias to avoid publicity . In the legal sense , alias is not only an assumed name but may be another name by which a person is known to some people . Unlike the other nouns here , alias may be used adverbially . < Nom de guerre >  ( adopted from the French and meaning war name ) is a pseudonym adopted by a person who must conceal his or her true identity in order to retain freedom of action . Consequently , many persons engaged in controversies or in political activities opposing a prevailing regime find it necessary to adopt noms de guerre .

The specific overtone of purpose in either use is that of meaningfulness . The other nouns in this group do not carry this implication and concentrate mostly on the desired result rather than on the manner of moving toward it . Of these , < goal >  is closest to purpose in suggesting a selected result that can be won only with difficulty by dedicated effort . The emphasis on choice is more invariable here than with purpose , which might be supplied by someone else . A goal suggests a personal determination . Goal is sometimes used in a vaguer way to mean the general trend or direction a person or group takes , without implying any final result . < Aim >  is often used in this vague way , suggesting a general tendency . In the singular , it implies a more concrete choice than goal , one that can be given succinctly . When used of a desired result , aim is most appropriate for a small or short-term goal and is consequently less dramatic in tone than goal or purpose . Aim also suggests less emotional involvement in the outcome than purpose and goal , and less determination that it will be achieved . < End >  is more formal than the foregoing nouns and is most specifically appropriate to philosophical or ethical discussions . Because end has other meanings that are more common , it is often restricted in this sense to uses in which it contrasts with the manner of achieving a given goal . < Object >  and < objective >  would seem too close in meaning to differentiate , but each has a context in which it is the more appropriate term . Object and objective are more formal than the other nouns of this group and are often used for impersonal planning of an abstract or general nature . Object would be most appropriate for an aim or goal that can be stated in a few words ; objective suggests a wider , more intangible set of goals that includes a good many imponderables .

Quit , a less formal word , is likely to be applied to employment for which wages , rather than a salary , are paid , or to a group activity that is not highly structured . Quit strongly hints at making up one's mind without much forethought or planning for the future .

Dropping out is most commonly applied to adolescents who leave school before earning a diploma and who thereafter may find it difficult to obtain employment .

Reckless implies wild , irresponsible action or emotion , indicating at worst a dangerous lack of self-discipline or self-control , and implying at the least a devil-may-care attitude or a frightening absence of forethought . Reckless may indicate extreme carelessness or unconcern in respect to oneself or to others . What distinguishes a reckless act from a brave one is not always the action itself but rather the attitude motivating it and the circumstances behind it . A police car or fire truck may , with siren sounding , drive at great speed through the streets and through red traffic lights without being reckless . A joy rider doing the same thing would be guilty of careless and reckless driving . Rash is not as extreme as reckless . Rash points to overhasty action taken in the heat or emotion of the moment , without due caution or regard for consequences . A rash or reckless accusation is one that disregards the possible consequences to both the accused and the accuser , himself , who might be sued for libel . < Precipitate >  suggests an action undertaken without sufficient forethought . < Foolhardy >  implies boldness exercised without consideration or judgment , pointing to action that is daringly reckless or downright foolish .

Recommend can apply equally well to situations in which help has or has not been solicited . < Advocate >  is the most like recommend of the rest of these verbs in emphasizing a positive declaration by the person giving assistance ; drawn from legal terminology , it is even stronger than recommend in suggesting an ardent espousal of a given course of action . In this context , advocate can imply tenacity or an unwelcome intrusion . < Prescribe >  compares with advocate and recommend in the sense that a positive statement is made , but it is more specific in relating mainly to a doctor-patient relationship in which the doctor prescribes remedies for an ailment .

They do not necessarily indicate that any one alternative is recommended as a solution to the problem in question . Advise implies an extensive and detailed examination of a person's situation , with several possibilities for action opened up simply by getting another insight into any difficulties . When used as an exact substitute for recommend , it adds an implication of politeness or of reluctance to seem overbearing . [ May I advise you not to lend him large sums of money ? Would you advise me where I should vacation this summer ? ] Suggest implies a single , tentative proposal that is not insisted upon . In some cases , the tentativeness implied by suggest may result from a fear of being rejected . < Counsel >  has come to have a specific reference to psychologists or guidance personnel .

Culpable is milder than the foregoing adjectives in that it would not be used for outrageous or egregious violations of a legal or moral code . < Blameworthy >,  like culpable , is concerned with assigning guilt for failure or misbehavior ; its tone may be factual and neutral . More generally , however , blameworthy can express censure , although it seldom suggests the moral outrage of opprobrious . < Regrettable >  is the mildest adjective in this group . It need not denote a critical attitude of censure at all , but rather a sympathetic understanding of someone's failings . It contrasts with the previous adjectives even more dramatically when it expresses pity for circumstances beyond human control . Sometimes , regrettable is used in a polite or genteel way to express disapproval in terms of sympathetic disappointment . Regrettable can even be used more forcefully as an ironic understatement for a severely critical reaction . In many ways , < deplorable >  is an intensification of regrettable . On one hand , it can express consternation and distress over what may not be anyone's fault . But when used critically , deplorable is harsher than regrettable and does not mask its criticism in irony or understatement . Like regrettable , however , deplorable would not be used for outrageously hardened , cruel , or brutal behavior .", "questionList": [{"question": "the {_?_} diffidence of public officials in taking firm stands on the city's problems ; a ____ criminal who robbed many people without the slightest twinge of guilt .", "options": ["opprobrious", "regrettable", "reprehensible", "deplorable", "culpable", "blameworthy"], "answer": "reprehensible"}, {"question": "the ____ diffidence of public officials in taking firm stands on the city's problems ; a {_?_} criminal who robbed many people without the slightest twinge of guilt .", "options": ["opprobrious", "regrettable", "reprehensible", "deplorable", "culpable", "blameworthy"], "answer": "reprehensible"}, {"question": "the {_?_} commercialization of Christmas .", "options": ["opprobrious", "regrettable", "reprehensible", "deplorable", "culpable", "blameworthy"], "answer": "opprobrious"}, {"question": "{_?_} negligence ; He displayed ____ ignorance in handling what started out as a routine personnel problem .", "options": ["opprobrious", "regrettable", "reprehensible", "deplorable", "culpable", "blameworthy"], "answer": "culpable"}, {"question": "____ negligence ; He displayed {_?_} ignorance in handling what started out as a routine personnel problem .", "options": ["opprobrious", "regrettable", "reprehensible", "deplorable", "culpable", "blameworthy"], "answer": "culpable"}, {"question": "an investigation to determine which of the officials involved in the scandal were the most {_?_} .", "options": ["opprobrious", "regrettable", "reprehensible", "deplorable", "culpable", "blameworthy"], "answer": "blameworthy"}, {"question": "a {_?_} lack of concern for the impoverished .", "options": ["opprobrious", "regrettable", "reprehensible", "deplorable", "culpable", "blameworthy"], "answer": "blameworthy"}, {"question": "a {_?_} lack of decisiveness that marred the effectiveness of an otherwise brilliant person .", "options": ["opprobrious", "regrettable", "reprehensible", "deplorable", "culpable", "blameworthy"], "answer": "regrettable"}, {"question": "It is {_?_} that such a talent died .", "options": ["opprobrious", "regrettable", "reprehensible", "deplorable", "culpable", "blameworthy"], "answer": "regrettable"}, {"question": "your {_?_} absence from my dinner party .", "options": ["opprobrious", "regrettable", "reprehensible", "deplorable", "culpable", "blameworthy"], "answer": "regrettable"}, {"question": "I find it {_?_} that Smith chose to display her inadequacies to us so conclusively by taking on a demanding role .", "options": ["opprobrious", "regrettable", "reprehensible", "deplorable", "culpable", "blameworthy"], "answer": "regrettable"}, {"question": "the {_?_} accident that crippled her for life .", "options": ["opprobrious", "regrettable", "reprehensible", "deplorable", "culpable", "blameworthy"], "answer": "deplorable"}, {"question": "{_?_} living conditions ; a ____ lack of compassion .", "options": ["opprobrious", "regrettable", "reprehensible", "deplorable", "culpable", "blameworthy"], "answer": "deplorable"}, {"question": "____ living conditions ; a {_?_} lack of compassion .", "options": ["opprobrious", "regrettable", "reprehensible", "deplorable", "culpable", "blameworthy"], "answer": "deplorable"}]}, {"wordSetString": "deputy,proxy,substitute,agent,delegate,representative", "original_discussion": "These nouns are alike in denoting a person empowered to take the place or position of another . < Representative >  in its wider application means a person or thing that stands for , acts for , or takes the place of another .

When describing an attitude , the nouns suggest an almost awed admiration for a person's views , accomplishments , or behavior , and the person so admired is often one's superior . Respect , in a way that honor does not , can refer to a feeling for one's equal . When respect and honor refer to a manner of treatment , they suggest a courteous , sometimes humble approach . < Regard >  is similar to respect or honor in that it can refer either to attitude or to treatment . The attitude suggested by regard , however , suggests approving friendliness more than humble admiration . It may sometimes suggest the attitude of a superior toward a favorite . In any case , regard is less austere than respect or honor . When regard applies to treatment , it contrasts with the two preceding nouns by referring to a thoughtful or attentive concern rather than humble courtesy . < Esteem >  suggests a favorable opinion of a person that is based on worth but is joined with a feeling of warm interest in and sometimes attraction toward the esteemed person . < Reverence >  and < veneration >  are alike in suggesting a profound honor or respect for someone or something . Reverence implies that feelings of love are mingled with honor or respect ; it can refer to an attitude or treatment , the object of which is looked on as exalted or inviolable . 'Veneration refers more to attitude than treatment and implies respect mixed with awe , as for that which we consider to be not only of great worth but almost hallowed . The remaining nouns relate almost exclusively to treatment . < Deference >  is restricted to possibilities of respect in this use . It suggests an even greater formalized courtesy and need imply nothing about the true feelings of the person showing such deference . < Consideration >,  by contrast , relates almost solely to possibilities of regard in this use . Here , even greater overtones of warmth are present , with thoughtfulness and concern more clearly motivated by sincere feeling .

As shown in these examples , deserved can be used both positively and negatively , whereas merited is more often used only for positive achievements . < Fair >  is the mildest and most general of these adjectives ; it is also the most subjective in suggesting an appeal to reasonableness and open-mindedness . < Equitable >,  more formal than fair , suggests a solution that is just and reasonable to all parties concerned , but not necessarily wholly satisfactory to all . It is often used in contexts indicating an acceptable compromise rather than those susceptible of sharp distinctions between right and wrong .", "questionList": [{"question": "a {_?_} heir to the property ; the ____ place of women in society .", "options": ["fair", "equitable", "merited", "deserved", "just", "due", "rightful"], "answer": "rightful"}, {"question": "a ____ heir to the property ; the {_?_} place of women in society .", "options": ["fair", "equitable", "merited", "deserved", "just", "due", "rightful"], "answer": "rightful"}, {"question": "protesting that he was still their {_?_} monarch .", "options": ["fair", "equitable", "merited", "deserved", "just", "due", "rightful"], "answer": "rightful"}, {"question": "a {_?_} trial ; arguing that a ____ society should forbid segregation of any kind .", "options": ["fair", "equitable", "merited", "deserved", "just", "due", "rightful"], "answer": "just"}, {"question": "a ____ trial ; arguing that a {_?_} society should forbid segregation of any kind .", "options": ["fair", "equitable", "merited", "deserved", "just", "due", "rightful"], "answer": "just"}, {"question": "promising to answer in {_?_} course ; a ____ punishment .", "options": ["fair", "equitable", "merited", "deserved", "just", "due", "rightful"], "answer": "due"}, {"question": "promising to answer in ____ course ; a {_?_} punishment .", "options": ["fair", "equitable", "merited", "deserved", "just", "due", "rightful"], "answer": "due"}, {"question": "asserting that there was no conflict between the censorship law and a {_?_} regard for civil liberties .", "options": ["fair", "equitable", "merited", "deserved", "just", "due", "rightful"], "answer": "due"}, {"question": "juries that allow criminals to escape their {_?_} punishment .", "options": ["fair", "equitable", "merited", "deserved", "just", "due", "rightful"], "answer": "due"}, {"question": "a {_?_} honor ; a ____ punishment ; a ____ award .", "options": ["fair", "equitable", "merited", "deserved", "just", "due", "rightful"], "answer": "deserved"}, {"question": "a ____ honor ; a {_?_} punishment ; a ____ award .", "options": ["fair", "equitable", "merited", "deserved", "just", "due", "rightful"], "answer": "deserved"}, {"question": "a ____ honor ; a ____ punishment ; a {_?_} award .", "options": ["fair", "equitable", "merited", "deserved", "just", "due", "rightful"], "answer": "merited"}, {"question": "a referee who was scrupulously {_?_} in all decisions ; claiming it was n't ____ that she had to do more work than her brother .", "options": ["fair", "equitable", "merited", "deserved", "just", "due", "rightful"], "answer": "fair"}, {"question": "a referee who was scrupulously ____ in all decisions ; claiming it was n't {_?_} that she had to do more work than her brother .", "options": ["fair", "equitable", "merited", "deserved", "just", "due", "rightful"], "answer": "fair"}, {"question": "The wage agreement was {_?_} to both management and unions , although both had misgivings about certain aspects of the settlement .", "options": ["fair", "equitable", "merited", "deserved", "just", "due", "rightful"], "answer": "equitable"}]}, {"wordSetString": "ceremony,liturgy,observance,rite,ritual", "original_discussion": "These nouns refer to the prescribed way of conducting a formal event of significance . < Rite >  now pertains mostly to a religious service , referring to the entire service as an entity . < Ritual >  includes but goes beyond this meaning by referring to the formal manner of conducting a rite .

Extort refers specifically to an official who compels someone to give the official something to which he or she is not entitled , possibly in exchange for an improper favor .

Rough can specifically indicate a coarse-grained surface . At its most specific , uneven suggests something , as a fine , configuration , or surface , that has more noticeable ups and downs . Rough , however , may also indicate irregular or uneven ground that is impenetrable , steep , or difficult to traverse . Less concretely , rough can indicate anything unrefined , harsh , or difficult . Uneven in its other uses stays closer to its reference to something with irregular variations . It can also refer to something unsymmetrical , unmatched , or disarranged . < Bumpy >  and < rugged >  are much more specific in their reference to rough or uneven surfaces . Rugged applies mostly to landscape , stressing an extremely uneven topography or a resistance to smooth passage . Rugged carries implications of harshness or toughness , as can be seen in more general uses of the adjective . Bumpy can refer to small surfaces as well as to landscape . In both cases , bumpy may suggest a generally smooth stretch that nevertheless has small hollows and lumpy projections . Often , bumpy refers to anything that results in travel that is full of jolts . < Crooked >  refers specifically to undesirable departures , great or small , from the horizontal or vertical . In more general uses , crooked can refer to anything skewed . Occasionally , crooked can be used with poetic force to describe something that is naturally uneven or rugged . < Jagged >  can also be used in this way , particularly of steep or extremely uneven topography . More specifically , jagged refers to small-scale shapes with sharp or needle-like edges such as those that result when something brittle is broken or shattered . As in the last example , jagged can refer primarily to an uneven configuration rather than to rough surfaces . < Serrated >  and < crenelated >  are the most technical and specific of these adjectives . Serrated refers to any saw-toothed configuration or edge . Crenelated refers most specifically to the regular notched upper edge that is typical of battlements .

To run is to move by regular , bounding steps in such a way that both feet are off the ground during part of each step . Running ( noun ) is a rapid , continuous motion and usually implies haste . A person may run in pursuit , in order to escape , out of eagerness , for exercise , or toward a goal in competition . To < race >  is to run very fast , often at top speed . Race implies urgency in running . It may suggest the pressing need to reach a goal in time . Or it may focus on a challenge , an attempt to outstrip competition in a contest of speed . Horses and dogs are raced as a form of sport . Athletes race in track meets , as in the 100-yard dash or the relay . To < sprint >  is to run at top speed , typically for a short distance . As a noun , sprint may denote a short race run at full speed throughout . But sprint may also indicate a short burst of speed in the course of a longer race , especially in the home-stretch . < Trot >  and < jog >  emphasize the up-and-down motion of restrained running .

A person who trots bobs up and down , body upright and knees lifted high , shifting his or her weight from leg to leg , but maintaining a quick , constant pace .

A person or animal that lopes is free from strain or pressure and is able to maintain speed for a long time without tiring . Applied to quadrupeds , lope indicates an easy , bounding movement or relaxed running . A horse that lopes moves at a slow gallop or canter . Applied to persons , lope suggests a long , loose , swinging stride in walking . In a looser sense , run may simply mean hurry off . Race may mean rush or dash . Trot suggests determination but may imply no more than a brisk , hurried walk . In a figurative sense , run may mean be a candidate , and race ( noun ) may indicate any competitive contest . Jog , on the other hand , suggests an utter lack of competitiveness , an easygoing indifference . Race may also suggest the tendency or compulsion to speed toward a goal . Or it may emphasize the desperate need to utilize time to the utmost .", "questionList": [{"question": "to {_?_} for the bus ; to ____ away from an assailant ; to ____ to meet a friend ; to ____ in a ____ .", "options": ["trot", "race", "jog", "lope", "sprint", "run"], "answer": "run"}, {"question": "to ____ for the bus ; to {_?_} away from an assailant ; to ____ to meet a friend ; to ____ in a ____ .", "options": ["trot", "race", "jog", "lope", "sprint", "run"], "answer": "run"}, {"question": "to ____ for the bus ; to ____ away from an assailant ; to {_?_} to meet a friend ; to ____ in a ____ .", "options": ["trot", "race", "jog", "lope", "sprint", "run"], "answer": "run"}, {"question": "to ____ for the bus ; to ____ away from an assailant ; to ____ to meet a friend ; to {_?_} in a ____ .", "options": ["trot", "race", "jog", "lope", "sprint", "run"], "answer": "run"}, {"question": "to ____ for the bus ; to ____ away from an assailant ; to ____ to meet a friend ; to ____ in a {_?_} .", "options": ["trot", "race", "jog", "lope", "sprint", "run"], "answer": "race"}, {"question": "They {_?_} for cover when gunfire was heard .", "options": ["trotted", "raced", "jogged", "loped", "sprinted", "ran", "run"], "answer": "raced"}, {"question": "I 'll {_?_} you to the comer .", "options": ["trot", "race", "jog", "lope", "sprint", "run"], "answer": "race"}, {"question": "to {_?_} 100 yards .", "options": ["trot", "race", "jog", "lope", "sprint", "run"], "answer": "sprint"}, {"question": "She passed the lead runner on the outside and {_?_} across the finish line .", "options": ["trotted", "raced", "jogged", "loped", "sprinted", "ran", "run"], "answer": "sprinted"}, {"question": "The dog {_?_} up , wagging its tail .", "options": ["trotted", "raced", "jogged", "loped", "sprinted", "ran", "run"], "answer": "trotted"}, {"question": "The child {_?_} obediently after her father", "options": ["trotted", "raced", "jogged", "loped", "sprinted", "ran", "run"], "answer": "trotted"}, {"question": "The candidate {_?_} around the park to show that he was in good condition .", "options": ["trotted", "raced", "jogged", "loped", "sprinted", "run"], "answer": "trotted"}, {"question": "The tireless old fellow {_?_} along , completing his first lap around the block", "options": ["trotted", "raced", "jogged", "loped", "sprinted", "ran", "run"], "answer": "jogged"}, {"question": "The batter {_?_} back to the dugout .", "options": ["trotted", "raced", "jogged", "loped", "sprinted", "ran", "run"], "answer": "jogged"}, {"question": "the grace and ease of a fox {_?_} along .", "options": ["trotting", "racing", "jogging", "loping", "sprinting", "running"], "answer": "loping"}, {"question": "a lanky Texan {_?_} along .", "options": ["trotting", "racing", "jogging", "loping", "sprinting", "running"], "answer": "loping"}, {"question": "Oh dear , I 'm late ; I 've got to {_?_} .", "options": ["trot", "race", "jog", "lope", "sprint", "run"], "answer": "run"}, {"question": "She {_?_} to the phone .", "options": ["trotted", "raced", "jogged", "loped", "sprinted", "ran", "run"], "answer": "raced"}, {"question": "I 'll {_?_} up there on my lunch hour .", "options": ["trot", "race", "jog", "lope", "sprint", "run"], "answer": "trot"}, {"question": "to {_?_} for office ; to ____ in a congressional ____ .", "options": ["trot", "race", "jog", "lope", "sprint", "run"], "answer": "run"}, {"question": "to ____ for office ; to {_?_} in a congressional ____ .", "options": ["trot", "race", "jog", "lope", "sprint", "run"], "answer": "run"}, {"question": "to ____ for office ; to ____ in a congressional {_?_} .", "options": ["trot", "race", "jog", "lope", "sprint", "run"], "answer": "race"}, {"question": "He {_?_} along doing odd jobs , seemingly unconcerned about his future .", "options": ["trots", "races", "jogs", "lopes", "sprints", "runs"], "answer": "jogs"}, {"question": "Her thoughts {_?_} ahead , anticipating the solution .", "options": ["trotted", "raced", "jogged", "loped", "sprinted", "run"], "answer": "raced"}, {"question": "The doctors {_?_} with the clock to save the child's life .", "options": ["trotted", "raced", "jogged", "loped", "sprinted", "ran", "run"], "answer": "raced"}]}, {"wordSetString": "disconsolate,melancholy,depressed,lugubrious,dejected,sad,blue,despondent", "original_discussion": "These adjectives all characterize unhappy or despairing states of mind and , in some cases , situations that cause or are evocative of such feelings . < Sad >,  the mildest and most general term , is also the least explicit , giving no hint as to how downcast a person may be or for what reason . One may feel sad because of the passing of summer , or sad because a child leaves home to be married . A funeral may be a sad occasion , but so may the cutting of a virgin forest for timber . A monkey peering out of a cage may have the sad eyes of a lonely old man . < Dejected >  literally means cast down in spirits and suggests a temporary state of disappointment and discouragement brought on by some external event . < Depressed >  and < despondent >  both apply to more prolonged states of sadness . Depressed describes an emotional state in which both physical and mental activity may be slowed down , sometimes to the point of apathy . The depressed person is flooded with feelings of hopelessness and low self-esteem , and tends to brood . To the casual observer , one who is depressed may appear to be so without apparent cause or , at most , for insufficient reasons . Despondent is sometimes used interchangeably with depressed , although the former often connotes great grief and a feeling of helplessness because of some catastrophe . < Melancholy >  suggests a habitual pensiveness and sadness that may not necessarily be unpleasant . It stresses the presence of sorrow rather than of pain . In the past , melancholy has been applied to persons suffering from the marked lowness of spirits associated with mental illness . It is rarely so used today , depressed and despondent having supplanted it in this sense . Melancholy may also describe things and places that have an adverse effect on one's good spirits . < Disconsolate >  means refusing or unable to accept consolation or comfort , as after a loss or disappointment . Disconsolate is more literary than despondent and carries the suggestion of an outward expression of sorrow or pain rather than of listlessness . < Lugubrious >,  while actually meaning sad or dejected , is now applied almost exclusively to a person or thing that is so excessively mournful or solemn as to be ludicrous . < Blue >  is a loose synonym for sad , depressed , or despondent .

Salary usually pertains to money received by white-collar workers or by executives in managerial positions ; it implies a sum figured by the week , month , or year and paid weekly or at longer intervals . Wage usually pertains to the earnings of skilled or blue-collar workers and on down the scale to manual and menial positions ; it often implies an hourly rate paid weekly or biweekly . 75 ; the low wages paid even for skilled labor . < Pay >  and < compensation >  are the informal and formal terms , respectively , for wages or salary in general . Pay is the preferred term in the military for the regular amount paid to personnel . In any case , pay most often suggests a permanent , recurring amount of money . Compensation in some cases might sound overly formal or roundabout , but it can pertain generally to a set amount that is paid once for a given service or for one performance . < Fee >  and < stipend >  are specific forms of compensation in the last sense described above . A . fee is usually charged by a professional person as a sum set in advance for performing a specific , one-time function . A stipend is most often an allowance , also set in advance , but in this case applying mostly to students who are awarded such a grant of money in the form of a scholarship or fellowship in order to pursue their studies . Stipend has been extended to any grant of money awarded for any reason . < Honorarium >  technically refers to the compensation given to a professional person for services rendered when law or custom forbids a set fee . Often , however , honorarium can become a mere euphemism for a fee so low that the honor of doing the work must make up for the inadequate compensation . < Emolument >  is the most formal of these nouns and would seem a needless circumlocution when it substitutes for the already formal compensation . Emolument has a unique area of relevance , however , when it suggests the money that becomes available to one upon being appointed to a particular office ; often this may include , by implication , fringe benefits , an expense account , or other indirect monetary perquisites in addition to the stated salary or fee .", "questionList": [{"question": "an executive {_?_} starting at $ 40 , 000 a year ; a minimum hourly ____ of $ 4 .", "options": ["salary", "compensation", "wage", "fee", "emolument", "honorarium", "pay", "stipend"], "answer": "salary"}, {"question": "an executive ____ starting at $ 40 , 000 a year ; a minimum hourly {_?_} of $ 4 .", "options": ["salary", "compensation", "wage", "fee", "emolument", "honorarium", "pay", "stipend"], "answer": "wage"}, {"question": "the gulf between the scale of {_?_} for clerical workers and that for teachers ; amateur golf competitions that rule out contestants who have played the game for ____ .", "options": ["salary", "compensation", "wage", "fee", "emolument", "honorarium", "pay", "stipend"], "answer": "pay"}, {"question": "the gulf between the scale of ____ for clerical workers and that for teachers ; amateur golf competitions that rule out contestants who have played the game for {_?_} .", "options": ["salary", "compensation", "wage", "fee", "emolument", "honorarium", "pay", "stipend"], "answer": "compensation"}, {"question": "the doctor's {_?_} for a general examination ; asking the lawyer what the / ee would be to take a case to court .", "options": ["salary", "compensation", "wage", "fee", "emolument", "honorarium", "pay", "stipend"], "answer": "fee"}, {"question": "a handsome {_?_} granted for advanced research .", "options": ["salary", "compensation", "wage", "fee", "emolument", "honorarium", "pay", "stipend"], "answer": "stipend"}, {"question": "Two geneticists , a poet , and four sociologists were awarded {_?_} under the foundation's fellowship program .", "options": ["salaries", "compensations", "wages", "fees", "emoluments", "honoraria", "honorariums", "paies", "stipends"], "answer": "stipends"}, {"question": "an {_?_} given a poet for a public reading of her work .", "options": ["salary", "compensation", "wage", "fee", "emolument", "honorarium", "pay", "stipend"], "answer": "honorarium"}, {"question": "literary magazines that give ten-dollar {_?_} for critical articles from college teachers who must publish to further their careers .", "options": ["salaries", "compensations", "wages", "fees", "emoluments", "honoraria", "honorariums", "paies", "stipends"], "answer": "honorariums"}, {"question": "the perfectly legal {_?_} that sometimes go along with certain appointive offices .", "options": ["salaries", "compensations", "wages", "fees", "emoluments", "honoraria", "honorariums", "paies", "stipends"], "answer": "emoluments"}]}, {"wordSetString": "instance,sample,case,example,illustration,specimen", "original_discussion": "These nouns refer to a specific thing or piece of data summoned up to represent or verify a general type or thesis . < Sample >  usually indicates something that is physically present for inspection as a representative of some larger entity .

But illustration can refer to any citing of specific material to supplement , explain , or demonstrate a thesis or train of thought . Illustration can also refer to something that is merely alluded to rather than actually presented . < Specimen >  stresses even more than sample the physical presence of a representative individual . Specimen is also clinical in tone , suggesting a laboratory or scientific context . As in the last case , specimen can often imply that something is dead or has been killed , but this is not always so .

The implication that an example is an aid to learning or study comes to the fore when the context is that of discipline . < Instance >  points to a concrete example or illustration of a general thesis , particularly one drawn from the past .

By contrast , case can refer to a whole argument rather than to its examples . It can also refer to a specific medical or psychiatric instance .

Also , sarcastic suggests single , ad hominem utterances , whereas sardonic may suggest a more far-reaching attitude of somber cynicism that is not always directed at a person . < Biting >  refers most specifically to remarks alone , but suggests incisive or telling utterances that may express animus but need not be personal in intent . < Cutting >  is close to biting , but cutting specifically indicates a harsh , personal rejection . < Caustic >  comes from a Greek root meaning bum .

The emphases of < sedate >  and < staid >  are on restraint in manners or behavior . Sedate points to unruffled self-possession and implies a flawless exterior of correctness , politeness , and propriety . Sedate can sometimes apply critically to people or manufactured things that are genteel or too refined . But when applied outside the context of human affairs , sedate can refer more generally to anything serene or tranquil . Staid is now used most commonly in a way comparable to the negative possibility for sedate , referring to manners that are straitlaced , unbending , prim , and pompous . < Solemn >  once could refer almost exclusively to an extremely formal and awe-inspiring religious ritual . This was extended to other rituals or formalities expressing a total commitment . Now the adjective can also refer to a person or manner unleavened by lightheartedness . As a term of disapproval , it can point to someone needlessly gloomy or lacking in humor . When applied to a lack of humor , < serious >  is much more neutral in tone ; depending upon context , it can be approving , disinterested , or disapproving . In a comparable context , < grave >  emphasizes an extremely serious manner that is intense and unrelieved . It may suggest as well a concerned , anxious , or troubled state . When both adjectives apply to a state of urgency or crisis , serious suggests an uncertain condition that could well result in danger or failure . Grave , however , may well suggest a state too far gone to expect full recovery , although it can be applied for emphasis to less extreme conditions . Both grave and serious can also be used for anything thought extremely bad ; in this case , grave is again an intensification of serious . < Sober >  and < earnest >  apply more strictly than the foregoing adjectives to human behavior and attitudes alone . Sober can refer at its most restricted to some-one who is free of the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs . Used more generally , sober can suggest a wide-eyed , clearheaded approach , particularly in response to a serious or grave situation . It can also indicate unwavering devotion to a task . Earnest stresses this last possibility for sober and adds implications of zeal , selflessness , and single-mindedness . Earnest can also apply to a momentary involvement in which some-one is engrossed or becomes impassioned . Neither sober nor earnest is useful in expressing disapproval for someone who is habitually solemn or overly serious .", "questionList": [{"question": "a {_?_} gathering of quiet but interesting people ;

Because see is so general , it carries few connotations beyond those that context may give it . < Watch >  stresses attention or fascination . Whether the viewing begins by accident or design , watch suggests the complete engagement of interest , at least while the watching continues . By contrast , one may see something happen and turn away without interest . Watch , furthermore , is common as an imperative , whereas see is much less frequently so used . < Look >  is like see in suggesting no particular connotations for the act of viewing something .

Witness may suggest either a deliberate or an accidental viewing . All the remaining verbs can be used in the imperative as well as the declarative , but in either case , their emphasis on attentiveness is apparent . < Notice >  suggests the taking in , almost by chance , of a small detail that may yet be important to some larger pattern . In the imperative , notice is a call to attend to some small detail that might otherwise be overlooked . < Regard >  suggests viewing at a distance in a safe , prearranged position or with a definite emotional attitude . < Observe >  is like regard in suggesting a process of viewing something from one or more vantage points , but it implies a detached , almost clinical frame of mind engrossed in a detailed examination .

In a technical sense , < sensation >  is applicable to an impression originating either from within or from outside the body and conveyed to the nervous system by the organs of seeing , hearing , touching , tasting , or smelling . However , sensation does not necessarily imply an identification of the stimulus . In general usage , the meaning of sensation is extended to include not only sensing but also the attendant emotional and mental responses . < Sense >,  as here considered , may refer strictly to the physical agencies ( taste , touch , sight , hearing , and smell ) by or through which a person or animal receives impressions . In the plural it is applicable to the total awareness of the world around one . Whatever one experiences through the senses is a sensation . < Perception >  in this context involves interpretation of a stimulus and recognition of the object that produces a sensation . Perception is always based on experience and is the process by which people become acquainted with their environment . Whereas a sensation does not suggest the agency of the mind , perception implies that the stimulus creating a sensation has been registered , however unconsciously , on the brain . < Percept >,  closely related in meaning to perception , is a term in psychology and is applied to the immediate knowledge and recognition of an object gained by perceiving it . A dog will have the sensation of seeing or even of smelling a chair ; it knows the chair is an obstacle to be walked around , but will gain no percept or perception of what a chair is . < Feeling >,  the most general noun in the group , is sometimes used loosely in place of sense , sensation , and perception . Feeling applies more precisely to the faculty by which one perceives sensations of pain , pressure , heat and cold , contact , etc .

Oddly enough , < rational >  rather than reasonable is the adjective here that is most emphatic about the value of reason as a guide ; this contrasts with the stress on experience implied by the previous adjectives .

Rational may also indicate a coherent mind , one that is not mentally imbalanced or at the mercy of overpowering emotions . < Lucid >  and < sane >  are both directed to this last meaning of rational .

Condemn , however , has a more neutral use to indicate something that does not measure up to official minimum standards of health and decency . Sometimes , the disapproval inherent in condemn in official use has advisory rather than legal force . Doom , referring originally to Doomsday , the day of the last judgment , can still sometimes suggest supernatural powers believed to determine a person's fate .

Otherwise , sentimental is widely understood as disapproving in tone , pertaining to an inappropriate willingness to be moved at the slightest prompting or by situations that do not warrant genuine feeling . Sentimental does not censure all feeling , only that which is trivial , forced , or excessive ; no one would think it sentimental to weep at the death of a friend ; many people , on the other hand , would think it sentimental to supply a funeral and tombstone for , say , a pet dog that had died . < Romantic >  has gone through a similar shift , although the split in meaning still exists . It once referred to the expression of deep feeling , or the valuing of feeling above form . As such , it names an artistic era or indicates works of art from any era that display this legitimate emphasis .

It can also suggest a rejection of trivial or sentimental attitudes toward such emotions . < Slushy >  is even more critical of such attitudes toward love than mushy . It suggests a rejection of love seen as occasions for self-pity , weeping , and a sentimental evasion of reality . < Maudlin >  and < mawkish >  are considerably more formal than the previous pair and more specific in meaning . Maudlin derives ultimately from the second name of Mary Magdalene , who was often depicted with her eyes swollen from weeping ; maudlin now suggests strong disapproval for excessive emotionalism , especially of a tearful sort . Mawkish emphasizes the falsity of excessive emotions , their awkwardness and feebleness , or their offense against good taste .

Both adjectives are commonly used for emphasis to reveal profound indignation on the part of the speaker or writer . They are more meaningful in suggesting attitude than in objectively describing shocking situations . Strictly speaking , a shameful act would bring shame or obloquy upon the person performing the act , and a disgraceful act would bring disgrace . This distinction is not commonly observed , and all that can be said is that disgraceful usually indicates a greater degree of indignation than shameful . Shameful may also suggest a note of sadness rather than contempt , as at an unfortunate condition . Disgraceful would be too strong in this context ; it is limited more usually to acts felt to be outrageous . < Dishonorable >,  though also revealing a highly critical attitude , has more objective relevance than either shameful or disgraceful and retains more of its original sense of imputing dishonor . It is a formal term of high seriousness and would not ever be applied to comparatively trivial circumstances involving manners or the like . Dishonorable applies to one's character and to one's good name . < Ignominious >  and < scandalous >  are both closely related to shameful . Ignominious suggests behavior that subjects one to humiliation ; scandalous suggests sensational actions that flagrantly violate accepted standards of morality and hence stimulate reactions of intense revulsion or contempt .

This note of vol-untaiy goodwill , however , may be totally absent . Join often suggests the action of a person who becomes part of an existing group . < Participate >,  although considerably more formal , is like one aspect of join in suggesting a joining or taking part in group activity . Participate implies a more active role than is necessarily the case with share or join . < Partake >  is closer in meaning to share than to join or participate , although it is more formal than any of these verbs .

As can be seen , shore most strictly regards this meeting of land and water from the view of the limit set on the water . < Coast >  reverses the Hew , indicating the Emits set on the land . Also , coast is most pertinent to a long stretch of land taken as a whole , making it most appropriate in reference to land masses along an ocean . One would speak of the shore of a small island , rather than of its coast . In contrast to these nouns , < bank >  applies specifically to any sort of land bordering a river . Coast would never be used in this sense and shore seldom , perhaps only when emphasizing a river's width . Bank , however , has an additional specific reference to a steep slope or jut of land above the water's edge . In this sense , bank would suggest a moderate jut of earth beside a pond or river ; if higher land or a stony outcropping beside a lake or tidal water is in question , the nouns bluff or cliff would be more appropriate in connotation . < Beach >  contrasts sharply with bank , referring to a gradual slope , especiaUy of sand , rather than to an earthy steepness .

While the two nouns are used interchangeably , sickness might be the more usual and general choice , illness the slightly more formal one . Also , since sickness can sometimes refer specifically to nausea alone , illness is sometimes used to avoid this implication when it would be inappropriate . Furthermore , sickness can sometimes imply an episode that temporarily incapacitates one , whereas illness can imply a longer-lasting siege that is accompanied by impairment but not cessation of normal functioning . Sickness can suggest external causation of the acute episode , while illness can suggest inherent weakness or malfunctioning as the source of chronic poor health . Also , illness is the word of choice for all mental disturbance , from mild neurosis through severe psychosis . When sickness is substituted for this neutral use of illness , an emotional coloration is added , implying greater seriousness or urgency or suggesting an attitude of condemnation . With a similar emphasis , sickness is often used in a more general way . < Disease >  is often popularly thought to apply only to sickness that is infectious or communicable . But disease can refer as widely as sickness or illness to any kind of bad health , with the advantage that its very generality yields no implications as to whether the sickness is acute or chronic , mild or harsh , or long or short in duration . By contrast , < disorder >  usually refers to a malfunction of mind or body that may be mild or serious , infectious or inherent , but is seen in some imbalance , as a metabolic or chemical defect , or in the improper working of some mechanism . Disorder can be useful because it leaves open the question of cause and points strictly to symptoms indicating that something is awry . < Malady >  is a more formal synonym for disease that may seem outdated in descriptive use , although it has a note of alarm that makes it useful in metaphorical situations . < Malaise >  refers to an indefinable sense of ill-being . It aptly describes a psychological state in which some-one feels ill at ease or disquieted for whatever reason . < Infirmity >  applies most concretely to a weakness of mind or body , but it may now sound too genteel as a substitute for disease or disorder . This is true as well in its extended uses . < Ailment >  can refer to a symptom or collection of symptoms that causes noticeable discomfort . Ailment too can sound out-dated , although sometimes it can have an informal or regional thrust . Ailment once focused more clearly on the enervation or depletion of one's sense of well-being . < Complaint >  now functions as an informal substitute for symptom .

In another context , consequential can often refer merely to the possessing of wealth or status . < Important >,  the most general of these adjectives , is also considerably less formal than the preceding adjectives .

In any case , important has been weakened by overuse , especially in the superlative , referring now to anything mildly interesting , noteworthy , or of value . < Momentous >  and < vital >  both refer to things that are crucial or essential . Momentous stresses the great and immediate impact of an event , though it also points to significant ramifications or results , like consequential , but without any suggestion that these need be undesirable . Vital , in contrast to momentous , can indicate an element that is organic and essential to the well-being or functioning of the whole . Deriving from the Latin word for life , vital often means crucial , or of life-and-death importance . It can also describe something dynamic , full of life and energy . With < grave >  and < serious >,  the emphasis shifts to something urgent or crucial and to something that promises to have an extremely undesirable outcome . Grave is the more restricted of the two , specifically suggesting something that may well have a fatal conclusion .

Like important , serious has been weakened by overuse , especially in the superlative . Categorically , serious can distinguish the sober from tire pleasant , light , or comic .

Honest may be considerably more neutral than sincere and may describe an isolated instance of truth-telling as easily as it suggests an unvarying character trait .

Heartfelt can indicate a rare inward intensity that is assented to completely . Heartfelt , however , is in danger of seeming too flowery in many instances .

It may refer , most simply , to relatively commonplace abilities gained largely through training . But it may also refer to ability that training alone could not account for without considerable natural talent . Even in this situation , however , skill would suggest a necessary adjunct of artistic accomplishment rather than its lifeblood . With < artistry >,  the situation is quite the reverse . Here all the imponderables of exquisite performance and accomplishment are indicated , and while training , talent , and taste play their part , they work in concert with other less common qualities . Because of the strong praise conferred by artistry , it is often used hyperbolically of nonartistic acts to suggest how creatively even a seemingly mechanical task may be approached . < Deftness >  and < adroitness >  are much nearer skill than artistry in their impheations . Deftness may suggest simple manual dexterity when this natural ability has been highly trained . Less concretely , it can suggest a trained ability to handle any sort of difficult situation . Adroitness also may pertain to skill at physical manipulation , but it is better able than deftness to suggest knowledgeable appropriateness of behavior in potentially charged situations . It is more likely than deftness to refer to an artistic act at a higher level than technical skill .

Finesse pertains to unusually excellent formal technique that joins to ordinary skill such imponderables as exuberance , taste , perceptivity , wit , or cleverness .

In reference to admittedly trained people , however , flair can suggest work with zest or dramatic impact that goes beyond mere adroitness or finesse .

Specifically , slave refers to someone who is owned by another and has no civil rights , particularly someone who serves involuntarily or is given no pay for services performed . Most countries now prohibit the possession of slaves , a practice endemic throughout history , as in the case of conquerors who commonly made slaves of conquered peoples . Trade in slaves still persists , however , in some parts of Africa and the Near East . In a more general sense , slave is often used now in informal speech to refer to anyone victimized by someone or something . slave to her own narrow egotism . < Bondman >  and < bondmaid >  are now archaic except in a historical context ; they refer to a man or woman bound to serve without wages . Unlike slave , these nouns could suggest a contractual agreement that might last for a certain term only and in which a degree of freedom was permitted to the bondman or bondmaid . On the literal level , < thrall >  and < vassal >  are also archaic , but unlike the previous pair , both have surviving figurative uses . Thrall once indicated some-one bound to personal service in a household ; vassal , by contrast , indicated someone who was the master of his own affairs but pledged to serve his lord in war in exchange for protection within the lord's domain . Thus , in its literal historical meaning , vassal contrasts sharply with these other nouns , since it could apply to people of any intermediate rank between the slave and the absolute master . When used figuratively , thrall can suggest someone intangibly bound to something , as a habit . Also , because of legends in which the use of black magic could make one an unwilling thrall to an evil person , thrall can suggest figurative enchantment , particularly a state of involuntary fascination . Vassal , by comparison , is more often used to refer to any kind of forced allegiance or dependency . < Serf >,  like bondman , is now mostly archaic except in historical reference . Under feudalism , a serf was bound to an estate and could not leave it ; whoever owned the land was perforce the serfs master . The serf , however , did have rights , unlike the slave , in that no one could drive him from the land nor deny his right to be there . Serf can be used loosely for anyone in servile subjection , but this use can sound imprecise or far-fetched . In Latin America , < peon >  once referred most specifically to someone held in involuntary servitude until he or she had paid a debt . Since this arrangement often proved permanent in practice , peon now refers to anyone so ridden by poverty as to be virtually a serf or , loosely , to any poorly paid laborer .

Slight also usually suggests a single , dramatic action rather than a gradual process of attrition . Whether or not a person has been slighted may be a matter of interpretation ; there can be no doubt about someone's having been snubbed . < Neglect >  is mainly restricted to the aspect of slight that suggests an inequitable division of attention , except that in this case the amount of attention given is even less than is true for slight . Neglect may , however , suggest either an intentional or unintentional failure of attention , unlike slight and especially snub , where the failure is most clearly conscious and deliberate . Neglect in its very generality can also apply to situations where courtesy or propriety is the issue . < Disregard >  and < ignore >  are like neglect in applying to the more general context of failures in attention , but both verbs suggest a complete rather than a partial failure . In this case , ignore particularly stresses an intentional refusal to take account of a warning . Disregard implies a denial of attention to something because of superior knowledge or more pressing considerations . While ignore suggests that something has been rejected without any conscious consideration , disregard can suggest a careful , wholly conscious evaluation that results in dismissal . When these two verbs apply to manners , ignore compares with snub in stressing deliberate rudeness , but whereas snub refers to the commission of an offensive act , ignore refers to the omission of even minimal courtesies .

Acedia ( or accidie ) sometimes replaces sloth in lists of the seven deadly sins , but it is now more widely thought of as referring to a state of mental depression , implying a despair so profound that no action or attitude is thought possible or desirable . Apathy is a much more informal substitute for this last use of acedia , suggesting emotionless unresponsiveness that may stem from discouragement or low morale . Apathy is often used sociologically to refer to a limp , passive attitude toward injustice among groups of people . < Anomie >  is specifically used in a sociological context to refer to a widespread social apathy that results in alienation , breakdowns in communication , hostility , and the weakening of norms of conduct . Anomie has become a fad word , used in less specialized contexts . Sometimes anomie can suggest a breakdown of norms that sets the stage for chaotic or anarchic violence ; in this sense , its suggestion of action puts it in sharp contrast with the other nouns here . By comparison , the more general < indolence >  refers strictly to an aversion to exertion or work . While this could conceivably give indolence a sociological context , more often it is used as a more formal substitute for laziness , emphasizing a deliberately chosen state of inactivity . But indolence need not always be disapproving . < Autism >  and < catatonia >,  highly formal and technical terms from psychiatry , describe extremely withdrawn states of mental unresponsiveness . Autism at its most general can indicate a tendency toward daydreaming and introspection ; at its most concrete it is used specifically to describe an extreme withdrawal in children that retards or destroys the development of such normal functions as speech . Catatonia indicates a similar kind of extreme withdrawal in schizophrenic adults , in which the psychosis takes the form of apathy , complete passivity , and inability to initiate the simplest actions .", "questionList": [{"question": "filthy , disheveled rooms that gave eloquent testimony to his life of {_?_} and debauchery .", "options": ["acedia", "torpor", "autism", "catatonia", "sloth", "anomie", "indolence", "apathy"], "answer": "sloth"}, {"question": "a {_?_} in which he stared out the window for days on end .", "options": ["acedia", "torpor", "autism", "catatonia", "sloth", "anomie", "indolence", "apathy"], "answer": "torpor"}, {"question": "bouts of frenzied activity alternating with months of hopelessness and {_?_} .", "options": ["acedia", "torpor", "autism", "catatonia", "sloth", "anomie", "indolence", "apathy"], "answer": "acedia"}, {"question": "looking upon his parents ' quarrels with growing pessimism and {_?_} .", "options": ["acedia", "torpor", "autism", "catatonia", "sloth", "anomie", "indolence", "apathy"], "answer": "apathy"}, {"question": "slum children who face their constricted future with understandable {_?_} ; the ____ of the German middle classes when faced with die rise of Hitler .", "options": ["acedia", "torpor", "autism", "catatonia", "sloth", "anomie", "indolence", "apathy"], "answer": "apathy"}, {"question": "slum children who face their constricted future with understandable ____ ; the {_?_} of the German middle classes when faced with die rise of Hitler .", "options": ["acedia", "torpor", "autism", "catatonia", "sloth", "anomie", "indolence", "apathy"], "answer": "apathy"}, {"question": "the new delinquency among children of affluent parents , reflecting a widespread {_?_} among the wealthy .", "options": ["acedia", "torpor", "autism", "catatonia", "sloth", "anomie", "indolence", "apathy"], "answer": "anomie"}, {"question": "the pampered {_?_} of the jet set .", "options": ["acedia", "torpor", "autism", "catatonia", "sloth", "anomie", "indolence", "apathy"], "answer": "indolence"}, {"question": "a glorious week of {_?_} at the beach .", "options": ["acedia", "torpor", "autism", "catatonia", "sloth", "anomie", "indolence", "apathy"], "answer": "indolence"}, {"question": "the years of intensive face-to-face effort involved in treating a single case of {_?_} .", "options": ["acedia", "torpor", "autism", "catatonia", "sloth", "anomie", "indolence", "apathy"], "answer": "autism"}, {"question": "patients who , afflicted with {_?_} , sit in the same uncomfortable positions for hours rather than shifting to a more comfortable posture .", "options": ["acedia", "torpor", "autism", "catatonia", "sloth", "anomie", "indolence", "apathy"], "answer": "catatonia"}]}, {"wordSetString": "gradual,sluggish,leisurely,retarded,deliberate,slow,laggard,slack,dilatory", "original_discussion": "These adjectives are here compared as they apply to persons who do not accomplish things quickly or to actions that consume a great deal of time , often more than is considered necessary . < Slow >,  the most general , means extending or occurring over a relatively long span of time . Slow may be positive in its application to persons . It may also suggest such undesirable traits as laziness or stupidity . Often , slow indicates no more than not fast in progress or prompt in action . < Gradual >  and < leisurely >  are never applied to persons . Gradual stresses advancement by slow or even imperceptible steps or degrees , but it involves continuing progress . Anything leisurely is performed with no thought of a time limit and may be slow or simply unhurried and relaxed . < Deliberate >  in this context adds to slow the connotation of caution and care . A person who is deliberate acts after weighing all aspects of a situation ; a methodical person tends to plan work in a deliberate manner . < Dilatory >  and < laggard >  bring to slow the concept of delay . The dilatory person wastes time by being slow in doing what he or she could or should do promptly and procrastinates either through lack of self-discipline or an unwillingness to apply effort . Laggard , a stronger and more censorious word , implies lingering and falling behind in progress through laziness and a refusal to make an effort . < Slack >  and < sluggish >  both stress having little motion or alertness . To be slack is not only to be slow , but to be negligent in the performance of duties . Used of a period of time , it refers to a temporary lessening of activity in some endeavor . Sluggish more than slack implies reluctance and sometimes an inability to move forward . In a general sense sluggish is often applied to both physical and mental lethargy .

Both may be used loosely and interchangeably , but little without doubt suggests the more extreme departure from a norm . Small may suggest a slight reduction of proportions that is noticeable but not necessarily objectionable . Little , by contrast , suggests a reduction in scale that may be drastic . When small and little refer to the physical proportions of a person , they suggest an overall reduction of scale , with little the more extreme . By contrast , < short >  is restricted to a reduction in the scale of normal physical height . In this sense short may also be applied to parts of a human or animal body . In reference to things , short is applied to that which has relatively little linear extension or vertical length . Short may also emphasize that something does not measure up to a standard or need in some way . < Squat >  is an intensification of short , referring particularly to something that is of reduced vertical height but is not comparably reduced in its other dimensions , giving a low , wide silhouette . < Diminutive >  and < petite >  are intensifications of the meanings implicit in small . Both are more formal and are particularly used to refer to women's figures that are pleasingly trim and compact . While petite would seem affected when applied to things other than women's figures , diminutive can be used for anything of reduced overall proportions . < Tiny >  and < wee >  are intensifications of little , suggesting such a drastic reduction of scale as to put the thing described outside established norms . Tiny may suggest a miniature or model of something . In another use , tiny can more simply express surprise at something extremely small , even when it is of normal size .

They are often used interchangeably , and both may be applied to pleasant , unpleasant , or neutral sensations . But odor is the more nearly neutral word , being freer of connotations than smell and better suited to scientific contexts . Odor tends to take its character from the words that qualify it . Smell has a character of its own -- a simple , hearty , forthright quality better suited to the kitchen than to the laboratory . Odor may sometimes signify a more delicately pleasing perception than smell . And whereas a smell may sometimes be a blend of separate emanations , an odor is more commonly traceable to a single source . An < aroma >  is an odor both pleasing and distinctive , such as that given off by good food as it cooks or by good pipe tobacco as it bums . An aroma may be savory or smoky , or it may be delicate or spicy ; but it is always stimulating to the senses . < Bouquet >  is applied primarily to the delicate aroma that distinguishes a fine wine . A <scent>  is any odor , natural or artificial , that is or may be faintly diffused through the air . A scent is always delicate and often pleasing . < Fragrance >  is a sweeter , fresher , more pervasive scent . Scent and fragrance are the words properly applied to dusting powder and perfume . Smell and odor seem inelegant in such contexts , except when smell is used with simple sincerity , as by a child . Applied to the natural emanations of human beings , smell and odor often signify something unpleasant or offensive , though the nouns are not limited in this way . Fragrance is used only of women and often occurs in popular writing , connoting a fresh , clean smell . Scent denotes the characteristic odor of an animal -- a faint residual odor that lingers along the ground over which the animal passed . A natural human odor is referred to as a scent only when the person in question is being tracked down like an animal . Scent and smell may also denote the olfactory sense itself , but scent is usually reserved for animals , especially dogs , and suggests an unusually sharp sense of smell . < Stink >  and < stench >  are strong words and are applied to foul , offensive odors , smells that make persons hold their noses or that sicken them . Of the two , stink suggests a sharper sensation ; stench , a more sickening one . Both stink and stench apply to what is rotting or decaying , but stench denotes the stronger and more over-powering odor .

These adjectives , on their most literal level , are fairly clear in their neutrally descriptive distinctions from one another . In describing harsh disposition or behavior , however , their shadings of meaning are somewhat blurred . Sour applies almost solely to mood or disposition , suggesting a pessimistic , disenchanted , or excessively solemn attitude . Bitter suggests an even fiercer gloominess that arises from a sense of having been unjustly treated or from a deep-seated anger that smolders without catching fire . Tart applies more appropriately to particular instances of behavior and suggests impertinence or sassiness .

Acrid and caustic are the most intense of these adjectives in pointing to harsh dispositions or expressions . Acrid applies best to mood . It can also apply , however , to expressions .

It may also suggest someone who deliberately experiences something in order to report it . It may , in fact , refer to the report itself .

A speech may be either extemporaneous or prepared ; it may express feelings , ideas , or opinions ; impart information ; relate experiences ; set forth a program ; or outline a position . An < address >  is a carefully prepared , formal speech , as one delivered by a distinguished speaker or made on a ceremonial occasion . Also , where speech emphasizes the act of talking , address stresses the fact that an audience is in attendance . An < oration >  is an eloquent address meant to stir the emotions of a group or mass of people . It treats some important subject in a dignified style and manner , according to the rules of oratory , and is usually delivered on a special occasion , as at a celebration or a funeral . Since true orators are rare , however , the term oration may also be applied to a pompous speech designed for showy , oratorical effect . A < harangue >  is a long , loud , vehement speech appealing to passions or prejudices . It may be an extemporaneous tirade and is often intended to inflame those to whom it is addressed and to spur them to action of some sort . In a looser sense , harangue may apply to any long , bombastic speech , typically a tiresome one . Where oration and harangue emphasize the character of an address , the remaining nouns stress content and purpose . A < discourse >  is a fairly long , carefully prepared , well-organized speech on a definite subject . A < lecture >  is a discourse on a given topic intended to inform and instruct a group of students or some similar audience . Lecture derives from a Latin verb meaning read . The most effective lectures are not read , but giving a lecture does imply extensive previous preparation , including the writing down of what is to be said . Both < sermon >  ( the general word ) and < homily >  ( the more erudite term ) may mean an instructive religious discourse delivered by a clergyman to a congregation . Originally , a homily was a discourse or lecture explaining a Biblical text , while a sermon was an address from the pulpit dealing with dogma or ethics . Now the opposite distinction is sometimes made ; a sermon takes its theme from Scripture while a homily gives ethical guidance . In the Middle Ages , homilies written by learned churchmen were often read in churches , being used as approved sermons . Hence , the branch of theological study that treats of the art of planning , writing , and delivering sermons is called homiletics . In informal use , lecture , sermon , and harangue may all imply didactic moral instruction , referring to formal reproofs , stem rebukes , lengthy reprimands , or earnest exhortations to duty .

Speed can be used of any rapid and continuing motion . It is especially appropriate in referring to vehicles , machines , or inanimate projectiles . It can , of course , refer to the rate of motion and not necessarily to fast motion at all . Velocity has only scientific or technical uses and would sound pretentious in other situations . It can refer to rapid , continuing motion , but is more often used for rate of motion . Swiftness does not apply to rate of motion but is otherwise almost interchangeable with speed . It is slightly more formal , however , and would be used less for vehicles and machines than for living things . It may have a lyrical or poetic quality that is by no means trite or stilted . Unlike speed , swiftness often also refers to a brief interval . < Haste >  and < hurry >  both refer to a rushed manner of behavior . Haste is equally appropriate to formal and informal contexts and tends to imply the ineffective performance of a task , as in the motto Haste makes waste . When this overtone is absent , an extremely brief or partial action is still implied . Hurry is more informal than haste , but otherwise similar in its possible overtone of ineffectiveness . < Dispatch >  is much more formal than either haste or hurry and is opposed to them in implying rapid action that is both efficient and thorough . It also suggests the total completion of a task . [ Where could he find an assistant who could work with such dispatch ? The dispatch with which the children finished the leftovers astonished the adults at the table . ] < Promptness >,  while slightly less formal than dispatch , also suggests an efficient swiftness ; it is restricted , however , to refer to punctuality or to the accomplishment of a task in a given time . It can also refer to the briefness of an interval of time . < Alacrity >  and < celerity >  are the most formal of these nouns and apply more to readiness in a person's attitude than to speed of motion . Alacrity implies a cheerful willingness to act . Celerity may also be used in this way but , unlike alacrity , it can apply simply to the speed of a continuing motion .

Spendthrift was once , perhaps , more disapproving than it necessarily is now . Of the remaining adjectives , < prodigal >  is closest in meaning to spendthrift , though it refers beyond the spending of money to any lavish or foolish extravagance , often one of awesome proportions . Prodigal may be used without disapproval for extreme generosity . In any case , it emphasizes the amount of expenditure involved , whereas spendthrift can conceivably suggest the unconcerned spending of what one has , regardless of the amount . Sometimes , prodigal is understood as referring to someone who , after having wasted all of his substance , returns home in repentance , after the Biblical parable of the prodigal son . < Improvident >,  the most formal of these adjectives , indicates the unwise use of anything , with a specific emphasis on failing to foresee or provide for the future . < Thriftless >  relates to improvident in pointing to someone unable to save money or live economically , but the emphasis on futurity is not necessarily present . Thriftless is distinct from spendthrift in that no squandering need be implied ; an impoverished family could not be prodigal , though it might or might not be spendthrift with what resources it had . It would most likely , however , be compelled to be thrifty . < Wasteful >  is the most general of these adjectives in applying widely beyond the context of spending money ; it suggests an unwise or reckless misuse of resources that fails to get full benefit from them .", "questionList": [{"question": "putting their children on strict allowances to cure them of being {_?_} .", "options": ["prodigal", "spendthrift", "wasteful", "improvident", "thriftless"], "answer": "spendthrift"}, {"question": "a legendary {_?_} millionaire ; the penurious rich and the ____ poor .", "options": ["prodigal", "spendthrift", "wasteful", "improvident", "thriftless"], "answer": "spendthrift"}, {"question": "a legendary ____ millionaire ; the penurious rich and the {_?_} poor .", "options": ["prodigal", "spendthrift", "wasteful", "improvident", "thriftless"], "answer": "spendthrift"}, {"question": "uncomplaining when hard up , but {_?_} with windfalls .", "options": ["prodigal", "spendthrift", "wasteful", "improvident", "thriftless"], "answer": "spendthrift"}, {"question": "a {_?_} shopping spree ; the ____ extravaganzas Hollywood once turned out .", "options": ["prodigal", "spendthrift", "wasteful", "improvident", "thriftless"], "answer": "prodigal"}, {"question": "a ____ shopping spree ; the {_?_} extravaganzas Hollywood once turned out .", "options": ["prodigal", "spendthrift", "wasteful", "improvident", "thriftless"], "answer": "prodigal"}, {"question": "{_?_} in the time she spent with interns who needed help .", "options": ["prodigal", "spendthrift", "wasteful", "improvident", "thriftless"], "answer": "prodigal"}, {"question": "the {_?_} grasshopper in the fable that , unlike the industrious ant , had failed to lay in supplies against the winter ; ____ bon vivants who live with no thought for tomorrow .", "options": ["prodigal", "spendthrift", "wasteful", "improvident", "thriftless"], "answer": "improvident"}, {"question": "the ____ grasshopper in the fable that , unlike the industrious ant , had failed to lay in supplies against the winter ; {_?_} bon vivants who live with no thought for tomorrow .", "options": ["prodigal", "spendthrift", "wasteful", "improvident", "thriftless"], "answer": "improvident"}, {"question": "the average bachelor's {_?_} hit-or-miss budgeting of income .", "options": ["prodigal", "spendthrift", "wasteful", "improvident", "thriftless"], "answer": "thriftless"}, {"question": "{_?_} to spend so much on a dress you 'll wear only once ; ____ of the company's time , though miserly with my own ; tragically ____ of natural resources that can never be replaced .", "options": ["prodigal", "spendthrift", "wasteful", "improvident", "thriftless"], "answer": "wasteful"}, {"question": "____ to spend so much on a dress you 'll wear only once ; {_?_} of the company's time , though miserly with my own ; tragically ____ of natural resources that can never be replaced .", "options": ["prodigal", "spendthrift", "wasteful", "improvident", "thriftless"], "answer": "wasteful"}, {"question": "____ to spend so much on a dress you 'll wear only once ; ____ of the company's time , though miserly with my own ; tragically {_?_} of natural resources that can never be replaced .", "options": ["prodigal", "spendthrift", "wasteful", "improvident", "thriftless"], "answer": "wasteful"}]}, {"wordSetString": "unrehearsed,extemporaneous,unplanned,impromptu,unpremeditated,improvised,spontaneous,impulsive", "original_discussion": "These adjectives characterize actions taken on the spur of the moment or without forethought . < Spontaneous >  includes both these ideas and may often include suggestions of naturalness , frankness , and good humor . Sometimes , spontaneous is deliberately contrasted with such adjectives as routinized or conformist . In another use , spontaneous is sometimes restricted in reference to voluntary rather than coerced action , or to action that comes about by general agreement arising out of immediate circumstances . < Impulsive >  is far less positive in its implications than spontaneous . It may , in fact , suggest someone governed by or at the mercy of his or her whims or moods without regard for others . Impulsive , consequently , lacks the overtone of good humor present in spontaneous and can apply to ugly or disruptive actions as well as to pleasant ones . In some cases , impulsive can be used to describe actions occurring on the spur of the moment . < Unplanned >  is the most neutral of these adjectives in stressing only the lack of forethought and carrying no emotional overtones about the quality of the action . < Unpremeditated >  is the most technical of these adjectives ; in legal terminology , it refers to an impulsive crime committed without forethought and therefore unplanned . This would be less serious than the same crime devised in advance . Except in a legal context , it would sound stiff as a substitute for unplanned or impulsive , unless a comic touch were intended . The remaining adjectives pertain mostly to a context of public speaking or musical and theatrical performance . < Extemporaneous >  refers specifically to a speech delivered with few or no notes , but especially without a written version of the speech to be given . < Impromptu >  pertains , most specifically , to a kind of musical performance in which the music played is invented as the performer goes along . Impromptu is also often used of speeches delivered on short notice .

Both < unrehearsed >  and < improvised >  can be used in either a musical or a theatrical context . Unrehearsed , here , may suggest that a set piece is to be performed , but that the players have not previously practiced it . In this context , improvised would suggest a basic structure within which the players have considerable opportunities for spontaneous invention . Although improvised is generally used in a neutrally descriptive way , unrehearsed can sometimes suggest a negative judgment . In a more general context , unrehearsed approaches spontaneous in its implications , stressing a voluntary and unplanned telling or acting out .

In a narrow sense , a spy is one engaged in espionage -- that is , a spy is sent into a belligerent country to obtain military or political secrets . If captured , especially in time of war , a spy is subject to execution . In a wider sense , spy is derogatory and is applied to anyone who uses underhand and furtive methods of observing the activities of others , usually for personal gain . < Agent >  and < secret agent >  are now preferred over spy when signifying a person employed by a govem-ment to engage in espionage . An agent or secret agent enters a foreign country under a disguise and usually resides there for a time . The intent is to leam the military secrets and other facts about that country which will be of use to the agent's own government . An agent may also be sent within the borders of a belligerent power to commit acts of sabotage that will weaken the defenses of the enemy . Agent or secret agent may also be applied to investigators within a government who probe into treasonable activities , counterfeiting , or other infringements of federal laws . A <counterspy>  is an agent who spies on the secret agents of the enemy , often within the secret agents' country , in order to thwart their activities and destroy their efficiency . The < double agent >,  or double spy , is employed simultaneously by two opposing countries and engages in espionage against both of them while pretending to be working for only one . A double agent may actually be loyal to one country or may practice deception toward both sides . Double agents often make effective counterspies . < Agent provocateur >  is a French term designating a spy who is planted in a trade union , political party , or other organization in which there are conflicting loyalties . The method of the agent provocateur is to gain the trust of the members of the group and to stir them to actions or declarations that will incur punishment .

One may squeal out of surprise , excitement , fright , pain , anger , or protest . One may squeak because of a high-pitched voice or laryngitis . < Screech >  and < squawk >  refer to shrill , harsh cries or to sounds that are strident or raucous . A screech is a long , harsh , piercing sound -- a grating scream or shriek . One may screech out of pain , terror , or anguish . Screech is also disdainfully applied to a loud , high singing voice that sounds terribly forced and strained . A squawk is a shrill , harsh cry such as is made by a parrot or a frightened hen .

A chirp is a clear , bright sound -- a short , sharp , high-pitched cry , as one made repeatedly by a bird or insect . A person may make a somewhat similar sound ( or chirrup ) by drawing the breath through the closed lips , as in greeting an infant or urging on a horse . A cheep is a faint , shrill sound -- a weak , feeble chirp or squeak . A peep is the kind of tiny cry made by a newly hatched chick . Applied to human utterance , chirp means talk or say in a quick , vivacious way , or cry out cheerfully with birdlike enthusiasm . Applied to things , squeak designates a shrill , creaking sound indicative of stiffness or friction . Squeal refers to a loud , drawn-out , nasal sound reminiscent of a hurt , protesting cry . Screech implies a harsher , more earsplitting noise . In idiomatic speech , to squeak by or squeak through is to make it by a hairsbreadth , to succeed by an extremely narrow margin . In slang usage , to squeal is to turn informer , betraying one's confederates , as in crime . To squawk is to complain or protest loudly in a harsh , shrill way .

The relativity of steep can be seen in the fact that a grade too steep for a railroad locomotive might be considered a gentle rise for someone on foot ; terrain too steep for a burro to climb might not be steep enough to interest mountain climbers . Another connotation , even more subtle and not always present is the special suitability of steep for a rise viewed from below . By comparison , < abrupt >,  while referring to a much sharper slope , often suggests an incline viewed from above . This distinction , however , does not always hold . Abrupt suggests sudden discontinuities in a terrain rather than the gradual change implicit in steep ; consequently , a sharp contrast with surrounding topography is a special point of abrupt . Like abrupt , the remaining adjectives pertain to a nearly vertical incline . < Precipitous >  has special relevance to an incline viewed from above . Precipitous , by association with the adjective precipitate , also brings to mind suddenness or unexpectedness in referring to a nearly vertical incline that is clifflike . Thus , the unique point of precipitous may be its suggestion of an abrupt drop that is dangerous or perilous . It can be used , however , without this implication . < Sheer >  is related to steep in suggesting an incline viewed from below , but it is more intense than steep ; sheer often refers to a nearly vertical slope that may be impossible , not merely difficult , to negotiate .

In the last sense , barren has a Biblical ring and applies to women ( or a union ) rather than to men . Also , barren is less often used than sterile , since it may seem critical rather than factual . Sterile itself , however , can seem overly harsh to some ; this may be one reason why < infertile >  is often substituted for it , although infertile may refer to lack of success at having children for any reason , without necessarily implying that either the man or woman is biologically sterile . Infertile is also used in the agricultural sense , although its increasing use in reference to childbearing may have diminished its usefulness here . < Childless >  is the only adjective here that refers exclusively to people whose sexual union does not result in offspring . It points , however , to the simple fact of this lack , whether it comes about involuntarily or by choice .

In reference to people , sterilize may refer to accidental or deliberate acts and to acts bringing about temporary or permanent infertility in either men or women . It may also refer to an occurrence that causes no apparent alteration of the body , as with exposure to radiation , or to an operation in which reproductive organs are altered or removed . In practice , < neuter >  is most often limited in reference to the deliberate removing of reproductive organs from either male or female animals . Fix and alter are common euphemisms for neuter . < Spay >  functions like neuter but is applied exclusively to female animals . < Geld >,  similarly , applies to the neutering of male animals . Sometimes , however , geld can be applied to animals of both sexes , but this wider use is open to misunderstanding . < Castrate >  can apply both to men and male animals in specifically indicating the removal of testicles , less often to women in indicating the removal of ovaries . In the case of animals , castrate is clearer and more forceful than either neuter or geld . Applied to men , castrate would now suggest only sadistic punishment or a surgical necessity , as to prevent the spread of a cancer , but this was not always so . Castrate now carries the meaning of render impotent , either literally or figuratively , by psychological means , especially by threatening a person's masculinity or femininity . < Emasculate >  may apply to male animals but is more commonly restricted to men . Emasculate differs from castrate in referring more to the damage than to the actual removal of reproductive organs . Emasculate , however , is sometimes used euphemistically for castrate . Figuratively , emasculate refers , like castrate , to any act that reduces a man's sense of manliness . While less dramatic than castrate in this use , emasculate would seem to have greater metaphorical felicity , since no physical alteration is necessarily suggested by emasculate . Emasculate is also used as a generally applicable metaphor for weaken . < Vasectomize >  and < hysterectomize >,  the former applying to men , the latter to women , are medical terms for surgical operations that sterilize the person operated on . These terms are more commonly used in their noun forms . To vasectomize is to perform a duct-cutting operation that is chosen specifically to make a man infertile and is believed to have no effect on body chemistry . To hys-terectomize is to remove the uterus and sometimes the ovaries and fallopian tubes to stop uncontrollable uterine hemorrhaging , to remove large fibroid tumors , or to eradicate a cancerous condition .

As treated here , they all imply a distinction between such a disfigurement and those flaws present as an innate part of one's character . A person may acquire a < stigma >  because of some improper act of his own or , more arbitrarily , because of an unfortunate situation not of his own making . Sometimes , the special point of stigma is the disapproval of society rather than actual injury done to the person disapproved of . < Stain >, < blot >,  and < taint >  are almost exclusively restricted to the discredit someone has brought upon himself or herself ; the discredit , furthermore , most often is the result of a breach of morals . Of the three , stain suggests the greatest or most serious breach . Blot , by contrast , can be used almost euphemistically to extenuate a breach as accidental or slight . Clashing with this implication , blot appears sometimes in orotund rhetoric to mean an especially heinous disfigurement . In this sense , it is part of a common but shopworn expression . Taint suggests a moral breach slighter than either stain or blot . Leaving aside the use in which taint refers to a slight but innate flaw , it still stresses a vague or subtle imprint and may suggest , in fact , a less permanent discrediting than any of these other nouns . Even the underlying metaphor here is unique in suggesting a slight but permeating discoloration more than a single but plainly observable scar . < Mark >  is the least specific in this context and carries the fewest overtones . It has so many other uses that its sense of disfigurement would have to be made clear by context . < Stigmata >  is the one noun here that does not imply shame or dishonor , referring instead to marks said to appear miraculously on the hands and feet of certain saints , marks that correspond to the wounds inflicted at the Crucifixion . A < brand >  was originally a mark burned on criminals or slaves to proclaim their status ; it is now an easily identifiable design put on cattle with a hot iron to indicate ownership .

Stint suggests the limited period of time in which something is done .

In the military , hitch may refer to one's whole period of service , long or short . < Assignment >  is both more formal and more general than the preceding and is applicable in a great many contexts .

The two nouns contrast , however , in that the more general task is more nearly neutral in its connotations , whereas chore suggests something onerous , arduous , or even unpleasant , despite the short duration suggested . Also , task is less specific about duration and can suggest effort arising out of personal commitment or obligation . Chore nearly always suggests grudging reluctance . Used in the plural , it applies to routine household or farm duties and has a homey ring . In the context of a specific , short-term effort , < job >  and < duty >  emphasize different aspects of task . Job is neutral and general , open to the qualification of context .

Because of this limitation , asinine is even more disapproving than stupid ; its reference is to a beast of burden , the ass , traditionally considered stupid and obstinate . < Dense >  and < thick >  both concentrate on the aspect of stupid pertaining to a weak mentality , emphasizing an inability to understand simple facts or remember clear instructions . Thick may sound more formal , but it is also less harsh than dense , which suggests an impenetrable slowness of mind .

In this stylish is close to < fashionable >,  but is less formal , suggesting a more dramatic appearance , based on more transitory standards . By contrast , fashionable emphasizes elegance , correctness , and possibly a simplicity of expensive taste that is not likely to become dated so quickly . Stylish is also more open to being used as a contemptuous term . Fashionable , however , can also be applied to transitory or disapproved-of vogues . Fashionable , furthermore , is more likely than stylish to be applied to men . Used of men , stylish is likely to suggest a specialized subculture when it is not openly contemptuous . < Chic >  is in every way an intensification of stylish , except for its greater formality . Its French flavor points to that country as a source of high fashion for Western women , a fact emphasized by the adjective's restriction to female grooming . If anything , chic suggests an even greater concern for the last word in modernity , with emphasis on the exclusive and expensive . < Modish >  sometimes concentrates on the negative aspects of stylish , suggesting a concern with vogue to the neglect of good taste , comfort , or decorum . By contrast , < smart >  concentrates on a different aspect of stylish , referring to the dramatic impact of good design . Smart , however , puts less emphasis on vogue than any of the previous adjectives and suggests instead boldness of clean lines and simple cut , particularly those conceived of as being suitable for a specific occasion . Where chic suggests the apex of femininity , there is something of the opposite in smart , although its forcefulness need not suggest mannishness . Smart does tend to emphasize overall appearance rather than any one aspect . Smart , of course , can also refer to comparable aspects of male grooming without suggesting effeminacy . This paradox makes smart useful in joint descriptions . < Dapper >  and < spruce >,  by contrast with the previous adjectives , are mainly reserved to describe aspects of male grooming . Dapper may indicate the last word in formality and correctness . More often , however , dapper suggests overelegant and even prissy grooming . Spruce suggests masculine neatness and cleanness , with an emphasis on simplicity and timeless correctness of costume rather than conformity to fashionable vogues . Also , more than any other adjective here , spruce often bears directly on grooming to the exclusion of dress . Occasionally , spruce can refer to a woman's costume ; in this case , it emphasizes trimness and neatness .", "questionList": [{"question": "Leather coats were {_?_} for a season , but cloth coats will always be ____ .", "options": ["modish", "stylish", "smart", "fashionable", "chic", "dapper", "spruce"], "answer": "stylish"}, {"question": "Leather coats were ____ for a season , but cloth coats will always be {_?_} .", "options": ["modish", "stylish", "smart", "fashionable", "chic", "dapper", "spruce"], "answer": "fashionable"}, {"question": "beehive hairdos and other {_?_} vulgarities .", "options": ["modish", "stylish", "smart", "fashionable", "chic", "dapper", "spruce"], "answer": "stylish"}, {"question": "The sack , the shift , and the miniskirt all had their {_?_} , brief moments of glory .", "options": ["modish", "stylish", "smart", "fashionable", "chic", "dapper", "spruce"], "answer": "fashionable"}, {"question": "the double-breasted suit that has again become {_?_} .", "options": ["modish", "stylish", "smart", "fashionable", "chic", "dapper", "spruce"], "answer": "fashionable"}, {"question": "the {_?_} , bowler-hatted men of London's financial district ; the dirty jeans and tom T-shirt thought ____ among young people .", "options": ["modish", "stylish", "smart", "fashionable", "chic", "dapper", "spruce"], "answer": "stylish"}, {"question": "the ____ , bowler-hatted men of London's financial district ; the dirty jeans and tom T-shirt thought {_?_} among young people .", "options": ["modish", "stylish", "smart", "fashionable", "chic", "dapper", "spruce"], "answer": "stylish"}, {"question": "outraged to discover that her {_?_} evening dress , a signed original , was being sold in department stores all over town .", "options": ["modish", "stylish", "smart", "fashionable", "chic", "dapper", "spruce"], "answer": "chic"}, {"question": "women who looked like cadavers in their {_?_} chalk-white makeup .", "options": ["modish", "stylish", "smart", "fashionable", "chic", "dapper", "spruce"], "answer": "modish"}, {"question": "her {_?_} riding outfit .", "options": ["modish", "stylish", "smart", "fashionable", "chic", "dapper", "spruce"], "answer": "smart"}, {"question": "his {_?_} Ivy League suit .", "options": ["modish", "stylish", "smart", "fashionable", "chic", "dapper", "spruce"], "answer": "smart"}, {"question": "a {_?_} , well-turned out couple .", "options": ["modish", "stylish", "smart", "fashionable", "chic", "dapper", "spruce"], "answer": "smart"}, {"question": "looking {_?_} in a tuxedo .", "options": ["modish", "stylish", "smart", "fashionable", "chic", "dapper", "spruce"], "answer": "dapper"}, {"question": "quipping that he reminded her of the {_?_} little gentleman on wedding cakes .", "options": ["modish", "stylish", "smart", "fashionable", "chic", "dapper", "spruce"], "answer": "dapper"}, {"question": "sailors looking {_?_} in their whites .", "options": ["modish", "stylish", "smart", "fashionable", "chic", "dapper", "spruce"], "answer": "spruce"}, {"question": "coming back from the barber looking {_?_} and clean shaven .", "options": ["modish", "stylish", "smart", "fashionable", "chic", "dapper", "spruce"], "answer": "spruce"}, {"question": "her {_?_} skiing outfit .", "options": ["modish", "stylish", "smart", "fashionable", "chic", "dapper", "spruce"], "answer": "spruce"}]}, {"wordSetString": "check,repress,constrain,curb,subdue,restrain,inhibit,suppress", "original_discussion": "The pacification or putting down of unruly forces is suggested by all these verbs . < Subdue >  is the mildest , suggesting a gentle but firm power exerted to moderate an impulse that might otherwise be dangerous . Subdue implies that the threatening force has been put down but not necessarily altered or diminished in any basic way . < Inhibit >,  consequently , goes further than subdue in suggesting a fundamental altering of the rebellious impulse ; this is achieved , by implication , through blocking its chances for growth or decreasing the area within which it can continue operating effectively . Inhibit often refers disapprovingly to the diminishing of natural or healthy instincts . A similar relationship holds between < check >  and < curb >,  Like inhibit , check suggests the prevention of further growth ; curb , on the other hand , suggests the moderating force implicit in subdue . Check is stronger than inhibit , however , in sometimes implying the complete rooting out of an impulse . Similarly , curb is much stronger than subdue in suggesting the use of considerable force , when necessary , in order to counter any threatened unruliness . Because it suggests difficulty and struggle , in fact , curb has greater force than check , even though the latter points to the complete extirpation of an impulse . < Repress >  and < suppress >,  besides sounding so similar , are often used almost as though they were different spellings of the same word . They are differently defined by psychologists , however , and even in ordinary use a contrast in meaning can be observed . In psychology , repress indicates a process of returning to the unconscious mind fears and impulses so that they cannot easily be called up again ; this process occurs without the subject's knowledge . Suppress , in contrast , relates to an effort of will in putting away an unpleasant thought ; this act may or may not be conscious , and the suppressed idea can more easily be recalled for consideration . The ordinary uses of these two verbs reflect a similar comparison ; repress is felt as the stronger here , often implying a harsh or excessive stamping out of dissent or rebellion . Except for its greater force , it is thus similar to check and inhibit . Suppress suggests bringing something under control , like subdue and curb , although it suggests the use of greater force than either . < Constrain >  and < restrain >  are a comparable pair , but they are more clearly distinguished in common use than repress and suppress . Constrain indicates forcing someone to do something against his or her will and carries an overtone of disapproval for such an act . Restrain suggests a gentler , advisory moderation and may sometimes refer to a self-imposed discipline .

Except for someone who is extremely straitlaced , risque has fewer legitimate uses in today's relatively tolerant atmosphere , since many kinds of direct references to sex are not thought particularly bold . < Off-color >  has been similarly affected , although its vagueness still permits its application , particularly to jokes of any sort that hinge on sexual matters . Dirty joke is a more common description of this kind of humor . The remaining adjectives are not restricted to sexuality . Of these , < earthy >  is the broadest in application . If once it was disapproving for something coarse or crude in reference to sexual and bodily functions , it now may be descriptively neutral or even approving . Earthy may even suggest a sentimental nostalgia for the supposedly simpler and more direct life of earlier bines . < Racy >  can apply to accounts that are erotic , pornographic , or earthy , but in this case it suggests fast-paced action and a linguistic forcefulness gained through frank and direct expressions .

Summary implies a pithy paraphrase , with no attempt to catch the style of the original . Also , it refers almost exclusively to something that follows after and is based on the extended presentation , or even concludes it -- as suggested by the common phrase in speechmaking . < Abstract >  and < precis >  both refer to summaries written most often by someone other than the original author ; hence , they are seldom part of the original presentation , though they follow it and are based upon it . Like summary , they stress brevity and the schematic representation of essential points with no attempt to preserve flavor . Abstract most specifically refers to a scholarly or legal citation that gives the gist of what may be a complex argument or study . Precis may suggest a lengthier treatment than abstract and one adhering to the exact ordering of points in the original ; also , it is not restricted to legal or scholarly fields , applying to any summary of thought or argument in an essay or other nonfiction prose . Precis can even refer to a list-like presentation of entire fields of knowledge . < Outline >  and < synopsis >  relate to precis in that they both retain the point-by-point ordering of the original ; they are both most often a skeletal setting down of these points , but may be drawn up either by the author or someone else before , as well as after , the writing of the original . Within these possibilities , outline covers a wider range than synopsis . It often suggests a numbered and lettered list containing nothing more than key words or phrases , but may present an extended prose paraphrase . Synopsis usually refers to a plot summary of a piece of fiction . Ordinary prose sentences are most often used , rather than the numbered and lettered list suggested by outline . It may tell in capsule form events treated in a completed work or those planned for a projected work . Synopsis may also refer to a paragraph that retells previous action and introduces an installment of a serialized work of fiction . < Abridgment >  and < digest >  refer to more expanded treatment , suggesting condensation rather than a capsule paraphrase of the original . Consequently , what is presented after this shortening process may still be substantially in the original author's words and style . Of the two , abridgment suggests the least modification of the original ; it may refer , in fact , merely to the excision of a small number of passages . Abridgment can , however , indicate a greater amount of change . Digest refers to a boiled-down recasting of the original to present its essentials in shorter space . Although the original author's style and flavor may be retained at times , other passages may be rewritten for the sake of clarity or brevity .

peak , however , can indicate the whole mountain or its upper part , whereas summit is specifically restricted in reference to the topmost surface alone . In metaphorical use , this distinction is lost . Both nouns refer to the position of greatest importance , intensity , or power . Summit is the more formal of the two and has come to refer specifically to high-level conferences , as between heads of state . Peak suggests the point or moment at which something is most typical or at its best . Summit is less often used in this metaphorical way . < Pinnacle >  can refer to a turret or more commonly to a peak or its summit . It may , however , sometimes suggest a leaner , taller silhouette than peak . Used metaphorically , it functions as a hyperbolic substitute for peak , often in stock combinations that approach the cliche . < Acme >  can theoretically refer to a summit but now is almost exclusively used in a metaphorical way to refer to some abstract quality at its quintessential ; it also appears in stock combinations . < Apex >  refers to the vertex of an angle but can also indicate the tip or top of something or something at its maximum or its turning point . All three of these nouns can become empty metaphors , especially when used indiscriminately because of their imagined status or elegance . Neither < zenith >  nor < climax >  makes any literal reference to a mountain peak or summit . Zenith refers to the celestial point directly overhead . Metaphorically , it suggests anything at its highest development ; as such , it is a useful intensification of peak . Also , zenith is more often used to suggest something positive , whereas peak is not so restricted . Most concretely , climax refers to the turning point of a play or a kind of rhetorical buildup in an oration .

However , some people would exclude the possibility of such phenomena . To them , supernatural might be used to express skepticism or disbelief . Furthermore , supernatural has gathered suggestions that make it particularly relevant to the context of occultists and spiritualists . Since many believers would find such interests heterodox , this flavor of supernatural restricts its use in a more general religious sense . < Magical >  has far less complicated implications ; now it refers strictly to acts or things believed to confer supernatural powers .

In an aesthetic sense , symbol may refer to an element carefully chosen and deployed to have a desired effect . < Sign >  is often used in place of symbol to refer to a simple , arbitrary representation of an agreed-upon meaning .

Correspondingly , symbol refers to an indication that embodies a greater range of meanings .

Aaron's rod in the Old Testament is a talisman , as are the magician's wand and the cap of invisibility in folklore . In a figurative sense , a talisman is something that produces or is capable of producing extraordinary effects . In common use , talisman and < amulet >  are frequently confused . An amulet is a piece of stone , metal , bone , or wood inscribed with a magic incantation . It is almost always worn on the person and is supposed to protect the wearer from danger , disease , and witchcraft , or to ensure the wearer of success , as in love or war . Unlike a talisman , an amulet is supposed to confer passive protection and not produce active magic . < Charm >  is the most general of these nouns and includes anything that has occult powers . Talismans and amulets may both be referred to as charms . In modem times the small metal miniatures worn on chains or bracelets , and called charms , are no doubt a carryover from the old or primitive custom of wearing amulets . In the strictest sense , however , a charm is the uttering of words or rhymes supposed to produce magical results . By extension , charm is the power to allure or delight .

But more commonly it is descriptively neutral or even approving . When the latter is true , talkative may suggest an out-going person . < Gabby >,  the least formal of these adjectives , refers to a compulsive talker and as such is firmly negative in tone .

Unlike the previous pair , < loquacious >  and < garrulous >  are less concerned with verbal smoothness than with talk that is incessant or lengthy .

In related uses , assess may also refer to determining the amount of a fine . < Impose >  may suggest the determining of fines , punishment , or taxes in individual cases . More closely related to tax , however , is the reference of impose to a governmental decision , general in nature , to tap new sources of revenue or support . When its emphasis is on determination rather than collection , impose is like assess , except for its indication of a general decision . A legislative body might impose terms concerning the amount and source of new revenue , after which each affected person might be assessed and then taxed accordingly . Impose in these senses has neutral force , but it can easily be given overtones of repressive or arbitrary willfulness . < Levy >  may sometimes be used to indicate determination , like assess or impose . But more appropriately , as its root suggests , it refers to the actual raising -- that is , the collection or exaction of the amount assessed or the duty imposed .", "questionList": [{"question": "the average citizen who ends up being {_?_} according to income , general purchases , real estate holdings , buying of imported goods -- and even amusements and luxuries .", "options": ["taxed", "levyed", "assessed", "imposed"], "answer": "taxed"}, {"question": "{_?_} property at a higher valuation because of improvements made on it .", "options": ["taxing", "levying", "assessing", "imposing"], "answer": "assessing"}, {"question": "damages {_?_} by the court at $ 10 , 000 .", "options": ["taxed", "levyed", "assessed", "imposed"], "answer": "assessed"}, {"question": "{_?_} stiff fines on scofflaws ; ____ a light sentence on the first offender .", "options": ["taxing", "levying", "assessing", "imposing"], "answer": "imposing"}, {"question": "____ stiff fines on scofflaws ; {_?_} a light sentence on the first offender .", "options": ["taxing", "levying", "assessing", "imposing"], "answer": "imposing"}, {"question": "{_?_} additional ____ on business expansion ; ____ military service on young men and women .", "options": ["taxing", "levying", "assessing", "imposing"], "answer": "imposing"}, {"question": "____ additional {_?_} on business expansion ; ____ military service on young men and women .", "options": ["taxes", "levies", "assesses", "imposes"], "answer": "taxes"}, {"question": "____ additional ____ on business expansion ; {_?_} military service on young men and women .", "options": ["taxing", "levying", "assessing", "imposing"], "answer": "imposing"}, {"question": "a staggering burden of taxation {_?_} on those who can least afford it ; a policy of ____ unjust ____ on the colonies .", "options": ["taxed", "levyed", "assessed", "imposed"], "answer": "imposed"}, {"question": "a staggering burden of taxation ____ on those who can least afford it ; a policy of {_?_} unjust ____ on the colonies .", "options": ["taxing", "levying", "assessing", "imposing"], "answer": "imposing"}, {"question": "a staggering burden of taxation ____ on those who can least afford it ; a policy of ____ unjust {_?_} on the colonies .", "options": ["taxes", "levies", "assesses", "imposes"], "answer": "taxes"}, {"question": "a stabilizing of prices when the new {_?_} began to be levied ; British officers who levied troops and quarters from the colonists .", "options": ["tax", "levy", "assess", "impose"], "answer": "tax"}]}, {"wordSetString": "tutor,instruct,educate,indoctrinate,school,teach", "original_discussion": "These verbs refer to the process by which knowledge is imparted to students . < Teach >  suggests a guided process of assigned work , discipline , directed study , and the presentation of examples .

It is also used to soften the impact of a harsh reality . < Momentary >,  used literally , means coming and going away suddenly , in a moment .

Though in common use as a noun , transient has a formal or literary tone when used as an adjective . < Transitory >,  like temporary , points to impermanence . It designates something destined to pass away , either fairly soon or , at least , eventually . In a literal sense , < ephemeral >  refers to that which lasts only a single day . It is stronger than transitory in indicating not only certain but speedy extinction . For this reason , that which is ephemeral is looked upon as slight and perishable . Ephemeral can also sometimes carry a suggestion of contempt . In extension , ephemeral denotes that which changes aspect rapidly or continuously . Ephemeral is a rather literary word . < Evanescent >  is lyrical and evocative .

Thin in itself is descriptive of appearance , but is often qualified by adverbs that express the degree of thinness or the attitude concerning it . Like thin , < lean >  and < spare >  may have either positive or negative connotations . Both stress the absence of fatty tissue . At the same time , both imply an underlying muscular strength -- a sinewy and sometimes vigorous self-discipline .

In extended senses lean may mean fraught with want or hardship , not prosperous or productive . Spare can mean not plentiful , meager . < Svelte >  implies trimness and elegance of figure , and is often used in a complimentary way rather than as pure description . This use is suggested by the derivation of svelte from Latin roots meaning pluck out . < Willowy >  suggests a lean build marked by suppleness and grace . Svelte is feminine in connotation and is always applied to women ; willowy is not invariably applied to either sex , but since gracefulness is more common among women , willowy is more often associated with women . < Slim >  and < slender >  refer to relatively slight bodily weight , especially as it appears aesthetically to an observer . Slim , which may apply to either sex , implies a trim figure or physique . It is most often used in the context of someone's losing or maintaining weight . Slender , as applied to girls or women , often connotes gracefulness , litheness , frailty , or fragility . Slender may also be used of men , in which case it retains a suggestion of slightness of physique that is not considered unattractive or effeminate ; often slender is complimentary , but whereas slim suggests firmness and strength , slender indicates lightness . Slender is often applied to parts of the body . A person considered overly thin may be called < skinny >,  Skinny , a child's word , is always blunt and sometimes humorous or touching . Skinny stresses the idea that a person is underdeveloped -- nothing but skin and bone .

Throng emphasizes a group whose members are pressed together in a crush . Throng can also suggest a mass of tightly grouped people moving with difficulty in the same direction .

Cast has fallen into disuse except in the context of fishing and in certain stock phrases such as casting a net , casting dice , casting bread upon the waters . Pitch is specifically used in baseball to describe the throwing of the ball by the pitcher to the batter . Even in other contexts , pitch suggests care and accuracy of aim . < Bowl >,  as a term used in cricket , means pitch or hurl the ball to the batsman , usually on one bounce , with the arm held fully extended , not bent at the elbow ; otherwise , the pitch would be ruled a throw , which is illegal .

Like thwart , frustrate can suggest the undoing of an enemy's plans before they can be executed , although in this case the result is less conclusive than with thwart , since here it can imply merely forcing the enemy into inaction or into delaying plans . When the situation of enemies is not involved , frustrate may suggest any sort of insurmountable obstacle that reduces someone to galling inaction . < Inhibit >,  like one aspect of frustrate , suggests the forcing of something into inaction rather than a complete routing of it .

To < tip >  or < tilt >  something is to incline it at an angle , lowering or raising one side or end . Tip suggests a slight , momentary , or accidental movement away from a balanced position . It is often applied to something turned downward , thrown out of balance , or turned over . Tilt suggests a more decided or more stable shift of balance -- a marked , permanent , or deliberate positioning at an angle . < Slant >  and < slope >  may refer to stationary things , and both stress line rather than movement . Slant is the more general . It simply indicates an oblique placement or position . Slope involves a change of level or direction and is most often applied to the lay of land . A roof or hillside may either slant or slope ; but slope suggests the gentler , more gradual downward inclination -- except when qualified to the contrary . Slope is limited in application , but slant may be used in a figurative sense , suggesting a bias toward a particular point of view . To < cant >  something is to set it at a slant . Cant is close to tilt but is more formal and may imply a greater degree of permanence . An engineer cants the drafting table by setting one side higher than the other . To cant a timber is to cut off a comer or an edge so as to form a slightly slanted end . In nautical usage , a ship that cants swings around , taking a position oblique to some definite line or course . In another sense , to cant is to pitch toward one side , and to cant over is to turn over in this way . < Careen >, < heel >,  and < list >  are all nautical terms applied to vessels that lean sharply to one side . A ship , especially one under sail , careens , or heels over , from being buffeted by wind or waves . A ship lists when its center of gravity is displaced , throwing it out of balance . Careening or heeling is always toward one side or the other , but listing may be forward or astern as well . Careen may also apply to a ship standing in port and turned over on one side .

Trite is milder but more general than cliche , referring to overused expressions , obvious ideas , or a style that relies on either or both of these .

In any case , the fault of overuse indicated by cliche is more serious than that suggested by trite . < Hackneyed >  and < shopworn >  are the most condemning of these adjectives . Hackneyed points to expression , style , and content that befit a hack writer , that is , someone hired to do routine and commercial , if not trashy , writing . Extreme cheapness or vulgarity of expression is often indicated by hackneyed , and possibly dullness and lack of serious intent . Expressions might become trite or cliche by striving pathetically for elegance or loftiness . Hackneyed , however , suggests low , narrow meanness undiluted by striving of any kind .

Stale is unique in suggesting a process of dating that need not result through overuse . When overuse is suggested , the emphasis is on a lack of liveliness . Threadbare points to overuse that results in an expression's ultimate meaninglessness .

Reputable may be used of a solid , respectable , dependable person highly regarded by the community , or it may be applied to a firm known for the consistently high quality of its goods or services .

It appears in contexts of romantic love , conspiracy , and military tactics . < Date >,  by contrast , is the most general and informal of these nouns and is not often likely to suggest either a secret or illicit meeting .

As in the last example , the physical and emotional applications of turbulent may often coalesce . < Violent >  and < wild >  are the most general of these adjectives . Violent stresses destructive or uncontrolled physical force . In reference to human action , it stresses extreme agitation and often harmful or vicious behavior . Wild suggests an untamed state of nature . Used of a person , wild can suggest uncontrolled , uncivilized behavior . It can also suggest derangement or immorality . < Stormy >  and < tempestuous >  can refer to turbulent weather , but also to human emotion . In either case , tempestuous suggests greater force or intensity . Used of emotions , stormy indicates great agitation , but there is no necessary implication of potential harm or of an unpleasant outcome . In this context , tempestuous suggests forceful or disordered emotional intensity , but like stormy , no necessarily harmful or lasting result . Tempestuous can suggest the running of a range of emotions at their highest pitch ; consequently , it sometimes is used in describing art , particularly works from the romantic era . < Blustering >  is related to stormy and tempestuous in that it can refer to weather , but by contrast it suggests erratic gusts of wind or rain . As applied to emotions , however , blustering has a drastically different set of connotations , usually suggesting hasty , rash , angry outbursts of uncontrolled speech or action . Both < riotous >  and < tumultuous >  can apply to turbulent or violent groups of people . In this use , tumultuous is like turbulent , while riotous is even more forceful than violent . Tumultuous stresses noise , mass crowding , and erratic activity , but does not necessarily suggest potential danger or destructiveness ; it can , in fact , indicate the opposite . A riotous crowd , by contrast , is by implication one verging on angry mob action . Riotous can refer to any sort of bewildering array or profusion . It is , however , less likely than tumultuous to describe emotions . In this context , tumultuous suggests an extreme upheaval accompanied by surges of contradictory feelings during which the rational mind cannot sort out or control the developing confusion .", "questionList": [{"question": "{_?_} anxieties that drove him to suicide ;

Refractory implies more activity of resistance , suggesting an active rather than a passive disobedience . Refractory persons are both obstinate and rebellious , determined to protest the dictates of authority . A refractory metal or ore is one that resists heat or ordinary methods of reduction . Recalcitrant comes from Latin roots meaning to kick back . It is close in meaning to refractory but more extreme , implying uncompromising resistance or a disposition to be defiant . < Unmanageable >, < ungovernable >,  and < uncontrollable >  apply to things that are hard to handle or impossible to control . An unmanageable person or animal will not submit to guidance or direction . An unmanageable thing is incapable of being handled or dealt with successfully . That which is ungovernable cannot be regulated by rules or agreed-upon restraints ; it defies any attempt to tame it or to bring it under orderly , rational control . Ungovernable often suggests a loss or lack of self-control . Uncontrollable is the most extreme of these adjectives . It applies to that which goes beyond the bounds of control , as by being involuntary , instinctive , irrepressible , or wild .", "questionList": [{"question": "unndy boys creating a disturbance ; to plaster down an {_?_} cowlick .", "options": ["intractable", "unruly", "wayward", "recalcitrant", "uncontrollable", "restive", "refractory", "ungovernable", "unmanageable"], "answer": "unruly"}, {"question": "a home for {_?_} minors .", "options": ["intractable", "unruly", "wayward", "recalcitrant", "uncontrollable", "restive", "refractory", "ungovernable", "unmanageable"], "answer": "wayward"}, {"question": "a {_?_} curl .", "options": ["intractable", "unruly", "wayward", "recalcitrant", "uncontrollable", "restive", "refractory", "ungovernable", "unmanageable"], "answer": "wayward"}, {"question": "a {_?_} community , ripe for a riot .", "options": ["intractable", "unruly", "wayward", "recalcitrant", "uncontrollable", "restive", "refractory", "ungovernable", "unmanageable"], "answer": "restive"}, {"question": "an inattentive , {_?_} audience , impatiently waiting for the intermission .", "options": ["intractable", "unruly", "wayward", "recalcitrant", "uncontrollable", "restive", "refractory", "ungovernable", "unmanageable"], "answer": "restive"}, {"question": "The boy was shy and quiet , yet strong-willed , independent , and {_?_} , as stubborn as a mule .", "options": ["intractable", "unruly", "wayward", "recalcitrant", "uncontrollable", "restive", "refractory", "ungovernable", "unmanageable"], "answer": "intractable"}, {"question": "The source material was {_?_} , and there was little the librettist could do with it .", "options": ["intractable", "unruly", "wayward", "recalcitrant", "uncontrollable", "restive", "refractory", "ungovernable", "unmanageable"], "answer": "intractable"}, {"question": "a {_?_} lad , doing just the opposite of what he is told .", "options": ["intractable", "unruly", "wayward", "recalcitrant", "uncontrollable", "restive", "refractory", "ungovernable", "unmanageable"], "answer": "refractory"}, {"question": "Fire clay , a {_?_} material used to make crucibles and furnace linings , resists the highest temperatures of the blast furnace without melting .", "options": ["intractable", "unruly", "wayward", "recalcitrant", "uncontrollable", "restive", "refractory", "ungovernable", "unmanageable"], "answer": "refractory"}, {"question": "A {_?_} student who not only refused to obey any rule but threatened a teacher with violence .", "options": ["intractable", "unruly", "wayward", "recalcitrant", "uncontrollable", "restive", "refractory", "ungovernable", "unmanageable"], "answer": "recalcitrant"}, {"question": "a heavy but not {_?_} work load .", "options": ["intractable", "unruly", "wayward", "recalcitrant", "uncontrollable", "restive", "refractory", "ungovernable", "unmanageable"], "answer": "unmanageable"}, {"question": "an {_?_} land , beset with warring factions and internal strife .", "options": ["intractable", "unruly", "wayward", "recalcitrant", "uncontrollable", "restive", "refractory", "ungovernable", "unmanageable"], "answer": "ungovernable"}, {"question": "an {_?_} temper .", "options": ["intractable", "unruly", "wayward", "recalcitrant", "uncontrollable", "restive", "refractory", "ungovernable", "unmanageable"], "answer": "ungovernable"}, {"question": "{_?_} muscle spasms ; ____ anger .", "options": ["intractable", "unruly", "wayward", "recalcitrant", "uncontrollable", "restive", "refractory", "ungovernable", "unmanageable"], "answer": "uncontrollable"}, {"question": "____ muscle spasms ; {_?_} anger .", "options": ["intractable", "unruly", "wayward", "recalcitrant", "uncontrollable", "restive", "refractory", "ungovernable", "unmanageable"], "answer": "uncontrollable"}]}, {"wordSetString": "averse,hesitant,unwilling,reluctant,loath,disinclined", "original_discussion": "These adjectives indicate refusal to assent to something , or a cautious , grudging , or indecisive attitude toward it . < Unwilling >  points to a flat rejection and is the most forcefully negative of these adjectives . Unwilling can also indicate someone involved in something contrary to his or her wishes . < Loath >  ( or loth , as it is also spelled ) can be taken as having negative force equal to or surpassing that of unwilling ; this may stem from overtones supplied by the verb loathe . In common use , however , loath can suggest resistance to or distaste for something without implying the adamant refusal inherent in unwilling . This is especially true when one feels compelled to do something whether willingly or not . To illustrate the contrast with unwilling , it can be said that many draftees are probably loath to enter military service , but pacifists are more likely to be unwilling to serve . On the other hand , one might not be loath to do something and yet remain unwilling . < Averse >  suggests distaste that may be innate but in any case is so strong as to be unalterable . This deep-seated distaste , however , may or may not result in an unwilling response . < Reluctant >  may sometimes suggest firm resistance to something . More often reluctant indicates a grudging or provisional consent . < Disinclined >  is similar to loath and even more to averse in suggesting distaste for something . It suggests a weaker resistance than loath and averse , however , and may point to a cautious or prudent attitude that is habitual or is based on experience or evidence . Disinclined is alone in this set of adjectives in applying to opinions , views , or judgments as well as to consent or action . Sometimes , disinclined is used as a circumlocution for a more direct term of disapproval . < Hesitant >  suggests the least resistance of any of these adjectives .

When used in expressing an opinion on something already done , it implies an alternative considered to be wiser . When used as an advisory or precautionary term , it may sometimes imply considerable risk and possible danger . < Injudicious >  is milder , suggesting not so much lack of judgment as failure to exercise the best possible judgment in a sensitive situation . Where unwise may refer to something foolish or risky , what is injudicious is ill-considered or indiscreet . Unwise , injudicious , and < imprudent >  all point to a lack of foresight , a failure to think ahead and anticipate consequences .

It might also imply a deepening uneasiness difficult to objectify . < Agitate >  is more like upset in suggesting a sudden upheaval , but it contrasts with upset in specifically suggesting an unavoidable outward show of one's turbulent state of mind . The turbulence may also be the intensified expression of a chronic nervousness rather than the result of deep emotional shock . < Demoralize >  and < disconcert >  indicate a less intense upheaval than the foregoing verbs , suggesting that something has reduced one to a state of complete ineffectiveness .

Cultivated indicates a sophistication acquired through formal education or purposeful experience . Cultivated speech is educated speech , as distinguished from the speech of the ignorant , untutored , or illiterate .

To call people or their manners genteel implies anxiety about appearing cultivated , with the result that they appear pretentious or ridiculous . Buildings are sometimes described as being shabby genteel , indicating a ludicrous incongruity between the splendid original decor and its present poorly maintained condition or old-fashioned style .

All are of moderate informality . < Walk >  is the most general and neutral of these , encompassing all manner of moving on foot short of running or leaping . < Stride >  refers to a swift , purposeful way of walking ; it suggests long steps and an energetic rhythm . < Amble >, < stroll >,  and < saunter >,  in sharp contrast with stride , suggest a slow , wandering movement without a clear-cut goal ; each may furthermore suggest laziness , leisure , indecisiveness , or simply the enjoyment of walking . Amble emphasizes a leisurely but even movement , smooth and uninterrupted . The smooth , swaying motion suggested derives from a horse's amble , in which two feet on one side are lifted together alternately with the two feet on the other side . Stroll emphasizes a slower movement , more wandering and aimless , with suggestions of many starts and pauses . Saunter suggests an even movement , like amble , but it indicates cheerfulness as well . One might stroll while attending to disagreeable thoughts , but one would hardly saunter in such a state of mind . The rest of these verbs describe the manner of a per-son's walk rather than commenting on its larger intent . < Strut >  and < swagger >  intensify the cheerfulness of saunter . Swagger suggests showy overconfidence or egotism and functions mostly as a negative comment . Strut is even more disapproving in tone than swagger , suggesting an affected posture of bombastic self-importance . < Waddle >  means walk with short steps , swaying from side to side like a duck . When applied to people , it suggests an awkward , laborious gait , such as that of a very fat person .", "questionList": [{"question": "{_?_} through the depot well before the train would leave .", "options": ["swaggering", "sauntering", "ambling", "waddling", "strutting", "strolling", "striding", "walking"], "answer": "striding"}, {"question": "{_?_} along without stopping at any of the displays .", "options": ["swaggering", "sauntering", "ambling", "waddling", "strutting", "strolling", "striding", "walking"], "answer": "ambling"}, {"question": "{_?_} through the park with many a rest on benches they came across .", "options": ["swaggering", "sauntering", "ambling", "waddling", "strutting", "strolling", "striding", "walking"], "answer": "strolling"}, {"question": "whistling as he {_?_} along the beach .", "options": ["swaggered", "sauntered", "ambled", "waddled", "strutted", "strolled", "strode", "walked"], "answer": "sauntered"}, {"question": "{_?_} before crowds of fans .", "options": ["swaggering", "sauntering", "ambling", "waddling", "strutting", "strolling", "striding", "walking"], "answer": "swaggering"}, {"question": "the candidate who {_?_} about the room like a latter-day Napoleon .", "options": ["swaggered", "sauntered", "ambled", "waddled", "strutted", "strolled", "strode", "walked"], "answer": "strutted"}]}, {"wordSetString": "meander,roam,rove,range,ramble,stray,wander", "original_discussion": "These verbs refer to motion or to travel that is slow , aimless , pointless , or without purpose or goal . < Wander >  suggests a slow but possibly steady rate of movement . It usually indicates action that is idle or without purpose and is often applied to the movement of water , to travel , or to verbal discourse . As can be seen , wander acquires a severely negative tone when applied to verbal discourse , emphasizing confusion or ineptitude . In the same context , < meander >  might suggest an amused rather than a disapproving tone . More concretely , meander suggests the movement of water . Meander is less often used for travel , although here it can give a tone of amiable idleness . When used in the context of travel , < ramble >,  like meander , usually refers to a specific occasion rather than a habitual way of life . It can give a tone of pleasant relaxation , like meander , but is more concrete in suggesting a particular manner of walking , one in which a sauntering gait is linked with a start-and-stop unevenness of speed . When used of discourse , however , ramble takes on a negative tone like that of wander , referring specifically to any presentation in language that is lengthy , poorly organized , and full of digressions . Unlike the previous verbs , < roam >  and < range >  may both suggest a more serious purpose behind the uneven or circuitous movement . Roam , like ramble , can be used to indicate a pleasant stroll . The implication of making a thorough search or having some other specific purpose in mind , however , is seldom completely absent . Roam is furthermore the only verb here that is specifically associated with the grazing or foraging activity of horses and other animals . Range implies a thorough or systematic movement over a wide area . More often it refers to a sorting through or presenting of diverse ideas . More formal than roam , range also suggests more certainty of purpose , a deliberately various course , and a wide grasp of far-flung materials . < Rove >  and < stray >  both most readily suggest negative aspects of idle movement . Rove can sometimes indicate , with an effect of cuteness , the pleasant overtones of meander or ramble . Often it suggests a greater intensity or a more clearly defined goal , but particularly a more fickle attitude toward the experience at hand . As such , rove often suggests a cynical inconstancy in love . Stray , by contrast , is the one verb here that specifically emphasizes some-one who is lost or off-course ; with this sense , stray can apply in any context , including those that circumscribe other verbs here . Like rove , stray may refer to unfaithfulness in love ; more generally , it refers to sinfulness of any sort .", "questionList": [{"question": "a stream that {_?_} through the valley ; nomadic tribes that ____ through the desert from oasis to oasis ;

To call persons wealthy often suggests that they are established and prominent members of the community . Rich is blunter in tone and indicates only the possession of many goods or much money ; it is therefore more forceful when the purpose is to emphasize the great extent of someone's wealth . Wealthy can be used flexibly to describe various levels of wealth . Rich , on the other hand , is an either-or word ; one is either rich or not rich ; although one can be very rich , seldom is one spoken of as being moderately rich . Rich , unlike wealthy , is widely used in extended senses to mean full , pregnant , or abundant . < Affluent >  and < opulent >  are formal words derived from the Latin words meaning , respectively , to flow , and power or wealth . Affluent thus suggests an abundant flow of goods or riches , whereas opulent has a strong connotation of ostentation or showy display of wealth . Opulent most often refers to the products of wealth , whereas affluent describes people or human societies that possess wealth . The less formal < flush >  and the slang < loaded >  mean having plenty of money , especially money on hand at a particular time . Loaded may also mean simply rich , in the sense of having a lot of money . Both these adjectives differ from the others here considered in referring exclusively to money . < Prosperous >  and < successful >,  while implying the acquisition of wealth , do not indicate simply the possession of money and goods . Prosperous means thriving or flourishing , and suggests a temporary or developing state of affairs . A prosperous person or group need not be rich nor even moderately wealthy , but merely one whose economic situation is relatively good or on the rise . Successful moves one step further in broadening the context to include wealth as just one facet of meaning . As here considered , successful combines the sense of prosperous with the fulfillment of certain goals or ambitions , independent of wealth , and thus connotes a greater degree of stability or permanence than prosperous ; successful bankers , for instance , are those who have achieved prominence in their field , whereas prosperous bankers are those who are doing well financially . Nevertheless , since success is often measured by one's wealth , the role of wealth in determining what successful means is not to be minimized ; it is hard to conceive of a rich man or woman who will not be considered successful by most people , but it is not hard to imagine someone or something that is successful but not rich .", "questionList": [{"question": "one of our {_?_} citizens .", "options": ["most loaded", "wealthiest", "most opulent", "most affluent", "richest", "most successful", "flushest", "most prosperous"], "answer": "wealthiest"}, {"question": "He was not merely {_?_} -- he was ____", "options": ["loaded", "wealthy", "opulent", "affluent", "rich", "successful", "flush", "prosperous"], "answer": "wealthy"}, {"question": "He was not merely ____ -- he was {_?_}", "options": ["loaded", "wealthy", "opulent", "affluent", "rich", "successful", "flush", "prosperous"], "answer": "rich"}, {"question": "By astute manipulation of her stocks she became a {_?_} woman before she was forty .", "options": ["loaded", "wealthy", "opulent", "affluent", "rich", "successful", "flush", "prosperous"], "answer": "rich"}, {"question": "a moderately {_?_} family .", "options": ["loaded", "wealthy", "opulent", "affluent", "rich", "successful", "flush", "prosperous"], "answer": "wealthy"}, {"question": "a {_?_} find of rare minerals ; a full , ____ voice ; an experience ____ with meaning .", "options": ["loaded", "wealthy", "opulent", "affluent", "rich", "successful", "flush", "prosperous"], "answer": "rich"}, {"question": "a ____ find of rare minerals ; a full , {_?_} voice ; an experience ____ with meaning .", "options": ["loaded", "wealthy", "opulent", "affluent", "rich", "successful", "flush", "prosperous"], "answer": "rich"}, {"question": "a ____ find of rare minerals ; a full , ____ voice ; an experience {_?_} with meaning .", "options": ["loaded", "wealthy", "opulent", "affluent", "rich", "successful", "flush", "prosperous"], "answer": "rich"}, {"question": "an {_?_} community where every family owned at least three cars ; an ____ tapestry woven with gold and silver threads .", "options": ["loaded", "wealthy", "opulent", "affluent", "rich", "successful", "flush", "prosperous"], "answer": "affluent"}, {"question": "an ____ community where every family owned at least three cars ; an {_?_} tapestry woven with gold and silver threads .", "options": ["loaded", "wealthy", "opulent", "affluent", "rich", "successful", "flush", "prosperous"], "answer": "opulent"}, {"question": "{_?_} with their race-track winnings , they went on a spending spree", "options": ["loaded", "wealthy", "opulent", "affluent", "rich", "successful", "flush", "prosperous"], "answer": "flush"}, {"question": "We just got paid so we were all {_?_} .", "options": ["loaded", "wealthy", "opulent", "affluent", "rich", "successful", "flush", "prosperous"], "answer": "loaded"}, {"question": "a {_?_} farmer ; a ____ period of industrial growth ; a ____ business community .", "options": ["loaded", "wealthy", "opulent", "affluent", "rich", "successful", "flush", "prosperous"], "answer": "prosperous"}, {"question": "a ____ farmer ; a {_?_} period of industrial growth ; a ____ business community .", "options": ["loaded", "wealthy", "opulent", "affluent", "rich", "successful", "flush", "prosperous"], "answer": "prosperous"}, {"question": "a ____ farmer ; a ____ period of industrial growth ; a {_?_} business community .", "options": ["loaded", "wealthy", "opulent", "affluent", "rich", "successful", "flush", "prosperous"], "answer": "prosperous"}, {"question": "The child felt {_?_} when he found a dollar in the street .", "options": ["loaded", "wealthy", "opulent", "affluent", "rich", "successful", "flush", "prosperous"], "answer": "prosperous"}, {"question": "a {_?_} business in which the profit margin is small but reliable ; A ____ character actor for many years , he managed to five on his income by practicing frugality .", "options": ["loaded", "wealthy", "opulent", "affluent", "rich", "successful", "flush", "prosperous"], "answer": "successful"}, {"question": "a ____ business in which the profit margin is small but reliable ; A {_?_} character actor for many years , he managed to five on his income by practicing frugality .", "options": ["loaded", "wealthy", "opulent", "affluent", "rich", "successful", "flush", "prosperous"], "answer": "successful"}]}, {"wordSetString": "cry,whimper,weep,wail,blubber,sob", "original_discussion": "These verbs all denote the inarticulate sounds and shedding of tears indicative of grief , pain , or other strong emotions . < Weep >  and < cry >  are close synonyms and are often used interchangeably . Weep is more often used in writing than in speech and gives greater emphasis to the shedding of tears than to the accompanying sounds . Cry usually gives primary emphasis to the sounds although , paradoxically , it may also describe the act of silently shedding tears . Cry does not always indicate depth of feeling . Babies never weep . Both weep and cry can describe a variety of emotions . < Sob >  and < whimper >  describe different varieties of weeping . To sob is to weep with audible convulsive catches of breath and the heaving of one's chest . Sobbing is usually accompanied by gasps and is akin to sighing . Sob , more than weep or cry , implies pathetic circumstances . To whimper is to cry or whine with plaintive broken sounds ; whimper introduces the suggestion of defenselessness or timidity and is most often associated with fright . But whimper can also criticize ill-humored , unfounded , or self-pitying complaints . < Blubber >  and < wail >  stress the sounds accompanying weeping . Blubber means weep or sob noisily ; blubber reflects an attitude of ridicule or contempt on the part of the person using the verb , and is thus more abusive than descriptive , although in some contexts it may be used humorously to emphasize the inappropriate loudness of the weeping . Wail suggests a loud , unbroken , usually high-pitched cry . Wailing is traditionally associated with grief ; a wail is a formal cry of mourning . Nowadays , however , wail is most often used to describe any sad or melancholy sound , whether in grief or not . Otherwise , it is used more informally , like blubber , as a term of contempt , implying a weak , self-pitying attitude .

S . Weather Bureau . The Beaufort scale defines a breeze as a wind having a velocity of between 4 and 31 miles an hour ; breezes are further defined as light ( 4-7 miles per hour ) , gentle ( 8-12 ) , moderate ( 13-18 ) , fresh ( 19-24 ) , and strong ( 25-31 ) . < Gale >  is a general term for a very strong wind capable of doing considerable damage to property and usually regarded as hazardous for small craft at sea . The Beaufort scale defines a gale as a wind having a velocity of between 32 and 63 miles an hour ; gales are further defined as moderate ( 32-38 miles per hour ) , fresh ( 39--46 ) , strong ( 47-54 ) , and whole ( 55-63 ) . < Storm >  is a general term for any atmospheric disturbance , especially one marked by a great whirling motion of the air and accompanied by rain , snow , hail , etc .

Though whirlwind is the general name , it is chiefly used as a synonym for tornado , an extremely violent vortex of small diameter . A tornado , visible as a funnel-shaped cloud of dust that moves in a relatively narrow path , can be devastating in its destructiveness . In certain parts of the United States , a tornado is popularly called a cyclone . Twister is also a common popular name for a tornado , especially in the central plains . Technically , a cyclone is a vortex , usually hundreds of miles in diameter . In the northern hemisphere , the wind of a cyclone spirals counterclockwise around an area of low barometric pressure . A cyclone that originates over tropical seas deposits driving rain as it advances ; such a cyclone originating in the West Indies is called a hurricane , and in the western Pacific , a typhoon . A <squall>  is a sudden and violent wind of short duration and is often accompanied by rain or snow . Squall is perhaps most commonly used to describe a storm at sea .

In its full application , wisdom implies the highest and noblest exercise of all the faculties of the moral nature as well as of the intellect . < Sense >  is also very general in meaning .

Discrimination is closely allied to the second meaning of discernment , denoting an ability to perceive subtle distinctions , even when they might be blurred to ordinary observation . < Judgment >  is sense applied to making decisions , especially correct decisions , and thus judgment depends to some degree upon the exercise of discernment or discrimination .", "questionList": [{"question": "A truly great jurist bases decisions on {_?_} gained from far more than study of the law .", "options": ["sense", "judgment", "wisdom", "sagacity", "discrimination", "discernment"], "answer": "wisdom"}, {"question": "a highly developed {_?_} of right and wrong .", "options": ["sense", "judgment", "wisdom", "sagacity", "discrimination", "discernment"], "answer": "sense"}, {"question": "a politician who showed good {_?_} in avoiding mistakes made in a previous campaign ; a ____ that was reflected in all her business dealings .", "options": ["sense", "judgment", "wisdom", "sagacity", "discrimination", "discernment"], "answer": "sense"}, {"question": "a politician who showed good ____ in avoiding mistakes made in a previous campaign ; a {_?_} that was reflected in all her business dealings .", "options": ["sense", "judgment", "wisdom", "sagacity", "discrimination", "discernment"], "answer": "sagacity"}, {"question": "the old man's {_?_} about the dilemmas inevitable in a long life .", "options": ["sense", "judgment", "wisdom", "sagacity", "discrimination", "discernment"], "answer": "sagacity"}, {"question": "By applying {_?_} in screening jury panels , lawyers can do much to secure impartiality for their clients .", "options": ["sense", "judgment", "wisdom", "sagacity", "discrimination", "discernment"], "answer": "discernment"}, {"question": "a music critic whose {_?_} of great talent has been proved time and time again .", "options": ["sense", "judgment", "wisdom", "sagacity", "discrimination", "discernment"], "answer": "discernment"}, {"question": "chefs with such gustatory {_?_} that they can recognize any seasoning , no matter how delicate , that has been used in preparing a dish .", "options": ["sense", "judgment", "wisdom", "sagacity", "discrimination", "discernment"], "answer": "discrimination"}, {"question": "the fallibility seen in someone with a good heart but poor {_?_} .", "options": ["sense", "judgment", "wisdom", "sagacity", "discrimination", "discernment"], "answer": "judgment"}]}, {"wordSetString": "plaintive,pensive,nostalgic,wistful,moody", "original_discussion": "These adjectives characterize an introspective frame of mind that is sad , thoughtful , or intense . < Wistful >  stresses sadness that is mild and bittersweet , often suggesting a light longing after something past or impossible . Sometimes , wistful suggests an aura of sadness that is not unpleasant and not attached to any specific aspiration . < Nostalgic >  applies specifically to a longing for familiar or beloved circumstances that are now remote or irrecoverable . Nostalgic thoughts focus on actual events or people , whereas wistful thoughts may center on far-fetched hopes or past illusions . A wistful feeling may be casual or fleeting , but a nostalgic feeling is usually felt deeply and is often suggestive of a mood persisting for some time . Nostalgic , which suggests both satisfaction and regret , usually implies a warmth and intensity of feeling lacking in wistful . < Plaintive >  may stress any sort of longing , sorrow , or wish expressed in words or song . In current use , plaintive has drawn closer to wistful in not necessarily indicating utterance at all . The emotion suggested in this use is a shade more intense than that of wistful , with a possible suggestion both of greater hopelessness and greater need or desire . < Pensive >,  strictly speaking , can refer solely to a musing , reflective thoughtfulness . Very often , however , pensive is felt to imply a state of mind that is also tinged with sadness or resignation . < Moody >,  by contrast , can refer to a wide variety of emotions , including sadness , sullenness , or anger . Most typically , it might suggest any dark , depressed , and withdrawn state of mind , one considerably more intense than would be true for other adjectives here .

It is distinct from workable in that tvork-able views effective operation as if in a vacuum , whereas feasible may suggest a variety of impinging external factors that qualify performance ; a design , for example , may prove workable under ideal conditions and yet not be feasible for ordinary use . < Practicable >  is the most restricted of these adjectives in meaning .

Mind can also refer to a bundle of mostly conscious attitudes ( including the will ) , or to the entire psyche , conscious or unconscious . The remaining terms are all more nearly restricted to mental ability or rational faculties . < Intellect >  and < intelligence >  refer more exactly and more formally than mind to mental ability' . Intellect , the more restricted of the two , refers mostly to reasoning ability . It can be used informally to describe mental alertness or accomplishment . Used more formally in description , it requires qualification to indicate degree . Of the two nouns , intelligence is the more common , although it refers to a range of mental faculties wider than that suggested by intellect . Mental alertness , problem-solving ability , and keen perception of relationships are all implicit in intelligence when used without qualification . Intelligence can also suggest , with qualification , the degree to which these traits are possessed singly or in combination . < Brains >, < head >,  and < wits >  are all informal terms for aspects of intelligence . Head , the most restricted , usually pertains to a single faculty , often of a practical nature . Brains suggests a wider scope , like intelligence , but often refers to mental ability that has practical results . Wits refers specifically to alertness or sensitivity rather than to a general mental facility . Like mind , it can also refer to the conscious or rational intelligence . < Reason >  refers solely to the objective , rational part of the mind ; it is one aspect of intelligence .

More specifically , tradition means a particular observance so long continued that it almost has the force of law . < Custom >  refers to the habitual pattern of behavior of a community or people . A custom , while well established in usage , does not have the force of a tradition ; tradition emphasizes more strongly historical significance . A < convention >  is a rule or approved technique , and is applied to the arts as well as to conduct . While custom suggests a longstanding cultural habit relatively independent of the influence of ephemeral fashions , a convention might be considered an expression of the < manners >  of a people . In this sense , manners refer not to etiquette but to the modes of social behavior prevailing in a group during a particular period . Observing convention , therefore , implies a measure of conformity , even if unconscious , whereas observing a custom implies only the enacting of a habit shared with a great many other people . Manners in the sense here considered is often applied to literary works ; a novel of manners is a novel describing the social attitudes and behavior of a group of people -- often a stratum of society -- in a given place at a given time . < Manner >,  on the other hand , refers to a typical or customary way of doing something , especially a characteristic style used in one of the arts . < Practice >  refers to a usual way of acting , working , or behaving -- in short , a custom -- but , unlike custom , implies a voluntary choice . In a related sense , practice refers to individual habit . < Ethos >, < mores >,  and < folkways >  are terms most often encountered in sociological contexts . Ethos means the underlying and distinctive character or spirit of a people , group , or culture . The ethos of a group is seldom recognized by the members of that group , but it is nevertheless implicit in their manners and finds expression in their folkways . Folkways is not restricted to behavioral patterns but applies also to patterns of thought and emotional attitude . Thus , folk-ways is more closely allied to tradition than to manners . Mores refers to the established , traditional customs or folkways regarded by a social group as essential to its preservation and welfare .

It is used especially of material things having economic utility or monetary value , and may be applied to individuals , groups , or inanimate entities . In a broader sense , wealth may refer to the possession of nonmaterial things of value and may indicate a great abundance of anything . The other nouns in this set are used to denote specific kinds of wealth . < Property >  and < estate >  generally refer to material possessions . Property is the broader term , referring to any object of value a person or group may lawfully acquire and own .

Estate may refer to a usually extensive piece of landed property or to the residence built upon it .
